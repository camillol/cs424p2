	The Scary Announcer	You're taking a vacation from normalcy, the setting: a weird motel where the bed is stained with mystery, and there's also some mystery floating in the pool. Your key card may not open the exercise room because someone smeared mystery on the lock. But it will open the Scary Door.
	Announcer	Submitted for your Emmy consideration, a popular Senator with unpopular ideas.
	Senator	There's no such thing as space aliens!
	Man	Oh? How can you be so sure them aliens ain't already among us?
	Senator	I'll tell you how! [takes off the man's face revealing an alien lifeform] Because you ARE ONE!!!
	Lrrr	Hey, I was watching that! The Saints just needed a field goal to tie!
	Ndnd	Lrrr, you lazy ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8! You said you would conquer a planet today, but you have not even shed your skin yet!
	Lrrr	Yes, Ndnd. I heard you the first hundred times. I'll conquer something tomorrow after I fuel up on your disgusting egg-white omelets.
	Ndnd	You want yolks? Fine! Enjoy your stroke. [She throws the remote at him and walks out.]'
	Fry	Erth. [He mimics laser fire as a spaceship blows up the planet.]
	Invader X	Ha ha ha! I am conquering Erth.
	Leelis Lane	Not so fast, Invader X! Here comes Delivery-Boy Man!
	Delivery-Boy Man	Special delivery for Invader X! Laser eye power! [He shoots Invader X's ship with his laser eyes. The ship explodes. Cut to: Delivery-Boy Man in the ship, with Invader X threatening him in a gun.] Hand magnet power! [The gun flies into Delivery-Boy Man's hand.]
	Leelis Lane	[She comes free.] Yay! I'm unbuckled! [Delivery-Boy Man uses his "hand magnet power" to bring Lane to him.
	Invader X	Stop it, you hero!
	Delivery-Boy Man	Reverse-time power!
	Delivery-Boy Man	It's earlier now. [He and Lane kiss.]
	Fry	So? What do you think of my comic?
	Bender	Let me put it like this. After I leave here, I'm getting a memory enema.
	Leela	If I can offer some constructive criticism, there was never any real peril. I mean, the delivery guy has, like, 30 superpowers.
	Fry	Well, that's because he was bitten by a radioactive superman!
	Zoidberg	This is wonderful!
	Fry	It is, isn't it? Wait, those are the ads.
	Zoidberg	These X-ray specs will really take the guesswork out of surgery. No more chopping blindly in the goop.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Don't waste your allowance, Zoidberg. This stuff is butt-grade crap.
	Paper-hatted salesman	[on an ad] Amuse your friends with real vomit!
	Man #1	[on an ad] Throw your voice!
	Woman	[on an ad] Sea monkeys!
	Man #2	[on an ad] Throw your sea monkeys!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[on an ad] My disintegrator ray really works!
	Amy	But that's you.
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's how I know it's bunkum. The Farnsworth Novelty Disintegrator Ray is nothing more than a common teleporter ray. [He shoots a trashcan, it reappears next to him and he throws the toy away.] Worthless toy.
	Fry	I'm sick of being critiqued by nitpicking nerds. I'm taking this to a comic book convention!
	Amy	Smeesh, it's crowded!
	Bender	Good thing everyone is freshly bathed and groomed.
	Nerd	What are you doing? [He pulls the toy out of Zoidberg's mouth.] That's the rare Zapp Brannigan with recording session blooper! [He presses a button on the figure.]
	Action Figure	Don't tell me how to do the line. It sickens me.
	Zoidberg	But the sign said there was a mint in the box.
	Groening	Thank you so... Okay, thanks... Thanks so... Settle down!
	Groening	So, anyway, we're really excited to show you guys the pilot for our new TV series.
	Cohen	It's set it the year 4000, and we call it Futurella!
	Groening	Wow. Fox has really streamlined the process.
	Bill Morrison Robot	Matt will now take questions. But please, only about Futurella, not the Simpsons. Yes? The robot standing on the small child over there?
	Bender	Yeah, when are you going to make a second Simpsons Movie? [A panel slides open from underneath Groening's nameplate. A gun slides out and shoots Bender.] D'oh!
	Fry	Mr. Aragonés, I'm a big fan of your cartoons and your mustache.
	Aragonés	You want it? Take it. It's brought me nothing but misery.
	Fry	Wow. Thanks! [He rips the mustache off Aragonés' face and puts it on. Aragonés screams.] If you could just quiet down, I wanted to get your opinion of my comic book.
	Aragonés	Señor, anyone who still writes comics is a hero to me. [He smiles. Fry shows him the comic and he stops smiling.] Mmm. It stinks. But, um, I do like the tiny doodles in the margins.
	Fry	Oh, that's just some relish from a hot dog I found.
	Man	Attention, ladies and gentleboys, the costume contest is about to begin.
	Bender	[Running up to Fry.] The costume contest! The costume contest! [He runs off.]
	Leela	What the hell are you supposed to be?
	Bender	[In a crude Leela costume.] Every nerd's fantasy, baby.
	Randy Munchnik	[Dressed as Mario.] Next up, contestant number 36! [A fat man dressed as Spiderman drives up in a scooter. He shoots out whipped cream at the crowd then some into his mouth.] He drives off. Contestant 36, everyone. Next up, contestant 37...
	Lrrr	[softly.] I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet...
	Randy Munchnik	Hold on a second, let me just get this. [He adjusts the microphone.]
	Lrrr	I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. You are hereby conquered! Please line up in order of how much Beryllium it takes to kill you. [The crowd cheers.]
	Grrrl	[She takes off her Decapodian costume.] Damn, that's a good costume.
	Randy Munchnik	[As the Omicronians are being pushed off-stage.] Next up contestant 38!
	Lrrr	I don't understand. Why are the human still eating their soft pretzels instead of surrendering?
	Leela	[While eating a soft pretzel.] They're probably waiting for Joss Whedon.
	Lrrr	Joss Whedon's here? Wait a minute, you look familiar.
	Leela	Yeah, you almost ate me once. I was in your mouth for five minutes.
	Lrrr	Leela?
	Randy Munchnik	And the winner is, Nerdgasma! [Bender walks up.]
	Bender	Wooh, I've got fruit boobs!
	Lrrr	What's the use?
	Lrrr	Now what?
	Ndnd	I send you out to conquer a planet and all you bring back is J.J. Abrams' face? [A face is lying in a box, nearby.]
	Lrrr	I thought you'd like it. You haven't even tried it on.
	Ndnd	I might dress up in a face if you ever took me anywhere nice!
	Lrrr	Oh, boy, here we go. I built this castle with my own two slaves. What are you gonna to do, kick me out?
	Lrrr	I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. May I crash on your couch?
	Prof. Farnsworth	So he just showed up unannounced, raided the liquor cabinet, sprayed urine on the ceiling and passed out?
	Amy	And the walls.
	Lrrr	Leave me alone. My wife hates me and planetary conquest has become a chore.
	Prof. Farnsworth	There, there. You're just having a mid-life crisis.
	Lrrr	Mid-life crisis, eh? [He pulls out a ray-gun.] Lrrr demands the comfort of pop-psychological platitudes.
	Bender	Look, hoss, your wife threw you out. That's your license to be a jerk. Do whatever the hell you want then walk away and light a cigar. [He pulls a cigar out of his chest cabinet, lights it, and walks away.
	Leela	Don't listen to him. Bender may seem happy. [Bender can be heard laughing.] But in the long-tern, you need to reinvest in your relationship with Ndnd.
	Lrrr	Yes, it's clear what I must do.
	Lrrr	I like it.
	Surgeon	I'm thinking we downplay those hideous growths on your head. [A hologram shows Lrrr and it is changed to make him seem human with full hair.]
	Lrrr	Horns are a sign of virility. Also, they house my testes.
	Surgeon	I'm thinking horn extension.
	Bender	You'll need some arm candy. It's the perfect accessory for out-of-shape, middle-aged creeps like you. Yeah, I said it! What's your time, Borgnine?
	Lrrr	Big and angry. [He unzips his jacket and pulls out a magazine. He unfolds several pages to reveal a picture of a naked Omicronian woman. Bender's eyes zoom in then suddenly wilt.
	Bender	Look, brah, you just not gonna find a whole lot of hot, gigantic Omicronian babes in this solar system.
	Lrrr	There's one! [He stuffs his magazine into his jacket as the woman walks over.]
	Grrrl	Hey, cool cape. Were'd you get it?
	Lrrr	What, this old thing? I murdered my father. My name's Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
	Grrrl	I am called Grrrl.
	Lrrr	Of the planet Omicron Persei 8? That is a pretty name.
	Lrrr	What's on the TV tonight? Oh, wait! I don't care, because I've got a date!
	Leela	I know this isn't what you want to hear, but I think this is a mistake.
	Fry	Leela's right. That isn't what you want to hear. What you want to hear is that I fixed my comic book. Now the hero is more repeatable because he has no more ridiculous powers.
	Lrrr	Let's watch, shall we.
	Invader X	One more step and little Miss Constructive Criticism here gets it!
	Delivery-Boy Man	Oh, yeah? I may be just a simple delivery boy with no superpowers, so there's nothing I can do.
	Invader X	Okay. [He disintegrates Lane. Delivery-Boy Man bursts into tears.]
	Fry	So? Give me your honest praise.
	Leela	Fry, I've now seen two comic books, so listen to me. Why should I care about the hero when all he does is cry?
	Lrrr	Hmm. That dinner was a worthy foe.
	Grrrl	Yes, we shall not see its like again. So, um... [She begins kissing Lrrr.]
	Lrrr	Um, I'm sorry. I haven't done this in a while. I just got partway out of a bad relationship.
	Grrrl	Maybe I should take this off. [She begins taking off her dress and Lrrr's laser fires. Grrrl reaches back and unzips her costume, revealing her to be a human.]
	Lrrr	[He screams.] You're a human?
	Grrrl	Only physically. I'm a cross-species dresser. [She hangs up the costume.] Wait, you're an actual Omicronian?
	Lrrr	Oh, God. Oh God, what have I done?
	Grrrl	This is so hot! Conquer me, Lrrr! Sharpen your horns on my scaly thorax! [She jumps him.]
	Lrrr	[Sobbing.] I want to go home! But Ndnd would never take me back now.
	Leela	Ndnd just wants what every she-beast wants, to feel like you're listening to her nagging. Is there anything she has been riding your ass about?
	Lrrr	Conquering things, I guess. I could conquer Earth, kill all humans.
	Bender	There's a thought.
	Leela	No! We don't need a war of the worlds.
	Fry	That's it! We need a War of the Worlds! I'll call Orson Welles [He begins dialing his cell phone.]
	Bender	Dork calling Orson! Dork calling Orson!
	Welles	You're asking me, the renowned spokesperson for Paul Masson wine, to recreate my brilliant 1938 radio broadcast merely to decieve and impress the wife of this skinny reptile?
	Fry	Sorry. Never mind.
	Welles	I do it for free.
	Welles	Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of the Jonas Brothers and their orchestra to bring you a special bulletin. [Outside, the electromagnetic waves leave Planet Express and head to Omicron Persei 8.]
	Welles	[on TV.] I'm speaking to you from the hickory farms of Grover's Mall, New Jersey, [on the TV, an image of the Planet Express building appears. It has a sign that says Grover's Mall and a poorly designed, fake flying saucer is being dangled in front of the camera. Amy and Hermes exit the building, carrying a picnic basket.] through a mouthful of summer sausage, mmm, where I hardly know where to being. Mmm! [The scene of TV changes the saucer being dangled over a city made of household items.] A huge spacecraft, piloted by a devastatingly handsome... Now, how, in God's name, do I know what the fellow looks like if he's inside a ship miles in the air? [The scene cuts back to Planet Express.] It's just foolish on its face.
	Fry	If you want the cheese log, you'll read what I wrote.
	Welles	Very well. I shall comply.
	Welles	I'm getting reports that cities across the globe are being destroyed by this noble invader, whose good looks are apparently discernible across vast distances and through solid metal. [The "spacecraft" lands in front of the White House and Lrrr walks up.] But wait, the leader of the attack is swaggering out of his ship and up to a convenient nearby microphone. Now why couldn't I have just described his appearance at this point? This is the type of thing I'm talking about.
	Ndnd	Ooh! I could swear his horns have gotten longer!
	Kif	Sir, I've intercepted an Earth broadcast.
	Zapp	Put it up on the Zenith. [The fake broadcast is shown.] Oh, God!
	Zapp	To hell with Little Orphan Annie! We've got to do something.
	Lrrr	What's that, honey? How many dead? Uh, I don't know, 80 million? Okay. I love you, too. [He hangs up.] That was Ndnd, she's taking me back! [The crew cheers. Hermes is holding Welles.]
	Welles	I'm sorry I've been so difficult.
	Zapp	So, you thought you could conquer us so easily, eh? Nice job. We surrender. Earth is yours. [Lrrr chuckles nervously.]
	Welles	Damn, I'm good. Now, may I please have that cheese log?
	Zapp	Oh, glorious conqueror, permit me to offer up a sacrifice. [He holds up Kif.] How 'bout this?
	Kif	[Lrrr eats one of his legs.] Hey!
	Lrrr	Yeah, he'll do.
	Lrrr	Fine, okay. About this conquering thing. [He chuckles.] Funny story.
	Ndnd	Hello, Lrrr.
	Leela	Lrrr! Put a stop to this right now!
	Lrrr	Okay, okay. Quit nagging!
	Ndnd	Lrrr, why are you yelling softly with the purple-furred one?
	Lrrr	Uh, it's nothing, my queen. [He tosses Leela away and kisses Ndnd's hand.]
	Leela	He messed up my hair.
	Kif	I'm missing a leg.
	Zapp	We fought like Hell, sir, but in the end, we caved like a house of soufflé cards.
	Richard Nixon	Got it. Peace with honor. Well, I resign again.
	Ndnd	Come Nixon. Introduce me to the kitchen staff. I must lay down the law about Lrrr's low sodium diet. [She, Zapp and Nixon leave. Lrrr starts eating peanuts.]
	Leela	You've got to tell her the truth. And lay off the salted peanuts!
	Lrrr	I'm just trying to get the leg taste out of my mouth.
	Ndnd	Lrrr, I'm in here now, not out there!
	Lrrr	Give me a little time. With a lady like Ndnd, one must use finesse. [He walks away.] Coming, giangantums!
	Ndnd	[She eats a gem.] Mmm. That's crisp.
	Lrrr	Yes, but no more so than your squamous dorsal plates in the moonlight.
	Ndnd	[She shudders.] I am experiencing arousal. My organs are moving into position. [They kiss. Lrrr sees Leela looking at him and stops.]
	Lrrr	Ndnd, there's something that I've got to tell you.
	Ndnd	What is it? Is there someone else?
	Ndnd	The spark that reunited our marriage?
	Lrrr	Yes! Exactly. Good night. [He rolls over and pretends to be asleep.]
	Leela	Oh, lord! Now what?
	Lrrr	I couldn't tell her the truth!
	Ndnd	I knew it!
	Bender	[He pulls two frying pans out of his cabinet.] Frying pans! Cast-iron frying pans!
	Lrrr	It's not what it looks like! What do I do?
	Leela	Do what I say. Tell her!
	Ndnd	Tell me what? [To Bender.] Give me the heavy one. [She hands him some money.]
	Lrrr	The invasion was all a fake. I just wanted to impress you.
	Ndnd	You lied? What else have you been hiding from me?
	Lrrr	What else? Nothing else.
	Grrrl	I still want you, Lrrr, and I'm willing to fight for you.
	Bender	All I've got is a colander and a pie pan.
	Ndnd	Lrrr?
	Lrrr	Look, we only had one date. I barely mated with her.
	Ndnd	Whatever. I harbor no resentment against her. [She takes Grrrl's gun and shoots her with it.] What I want to know is what is up between you and Bossy Boots here.
	Lrrr	Her? She's just a bossy friend.
	Ndnd	Exactly! She nagged you, tormented you, and pushed you around. That is my job! This must be settled. I demand the ancient ritual of Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or Consequences!
	Fry	Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or what?
	Ndnd	Let the ritual begin. The rules are the same as in the home version. Lrrr must simply choose between myself and Leela...
	Leela	Fine. Hurry up.
	Ndnd	By shooting the one he rejects.
	Leela	Lrrr, I'm getting angry. Don't you go through with this.
	Ndnd	She is not the boss of you! I am the boss of you! [She throws Lrrr the gun.]
	Fry	Leela's gonna die. What wouuld Delivery-Boy Man do? [He looks at the comic. The superhero is crying.]
	Ndnd	You never want to do anything!
	Lrrr	Oh, nag, nag, nag.
	Ndnd	You want me to stop nagging? Then shoot me!
	Lrrr	Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
	Ndnd	Beats staring at your fat ass on the couch.
	Ndnd	Oh, yeah! Well I'll show you. [He aims at Leela.]
	Fry	[He jumps in front of Leela.] Ray-blocking power! [He is disintegrated.]
	Leela	Fry! [She starts crying.]
	Ndnd	Lrrr, you were willing to shoot that bossy temptress! You really do value my nagging above all others!
	Leela	Good night, dumb prince.
	Grrrl	[She runs up.] Come back, Lrrr! I wanna have your Popplers! They'll never be anyone but you! [She looks at Zoidberg.] Hello.
	Zoidberg	Of course1 I'll marry you!
	Amy	Wait, what the Shmell happened? I thought Ndnd disintegrated you with this ray gun.
	Grrrl	It's just a cheap teleporter. I bought it off the back of a comic book.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Cha-ching!
	Leela	The teleporter gun? But that means Fry might still be...
	Zoidberg	Fry?
	Bender	[He opens the shower. Fry is sitting there.] Is this him?
	Leela	Fry, you're alive!
	Fry	Not only that, I now know exactly how to end my comic book. Let's watch.
	Invader X	Say good-bye to your forehead, because I'm gonna shoot you in it!
	Delivery-Boy Man	Not if I leap in front of your death ray, and I'm going to do that. Jumping sound! Ow! [He is on the floor.]
	Invader X	I didn't shoot yet. As usual, your delivery arrived too soon. [He is crushed by a freak meteor.]
	Lane	Oh, Delivery-Boy Man! You saved me by random chance.
	Delivery-Boy Man	Don't thank random chance. Thank my meteor-wishing power, with your lips. [They kiss.]
	Leela	[She kisses Fry on the cheek.] Good ending. Not great.
