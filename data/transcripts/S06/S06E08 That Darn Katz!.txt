	Leela	Aw! Nibbler made a bobo for Mamma. I'll pick it up with my super-dupey poopy scoopy. [Nibbler grumbles. A truck can be heard backing up and Leela enters the room, driving a fork-lift.]
	Amy	Core magnetic field, 31 microteslas.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Nice.
	Amy	Temperature? Woah! The magma P.I. is 10,000 degrees Selleck! [Leela is emptying Nibbler's litter box in the magma. Amy swears in Cantonese.] Leela, I am collecting data. Can't you dump that somewhere else.
	Leela	Not really. It's highly volatile Dark Matter, and some corn.
	Amy	But I'm presenting my thesis tomorrow and I've barely had time to prepare.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Nonsense. You've been my grad student for twelve years. You were ready six years ago.
	Amy	What?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I probably should have told you. Anyway, the important thing is to be relaxed tomorrow.
	Amy	Are you sure?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes. Do what you young people do to unwind. Take a joyride in your jalopy. Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick. Go!
	Kif	Okay, amigos, one teensy drink to help Amy relax. [They drink.]
	Amy	Hmmm. I guess I'm still kinda nervous.
	Leela	One more teensy drink to help Amy relax. [They press buttons on their glasses and they refill by themselves. They drink again.]
	Fry	Still a little nervous? [Amy burps.]
	Bender	She's a nervous wreck! [They refill and drink again.]
	Leela	[At the table with Nibbler.] Well, I may not have a man, but at least I've got you, poopsie-doodle. [She pinches his cheek.]
	Nibbler	[He drinks.] Leela, it's time you and I had a talk.
	Leela	A talk? You can't break up with me. You're my pet!
	Nibbler	As much as I enjoy being the object of your misplaced affections, I am also a highly sophisticated being that longs for intelligent conversation.
	Leela	Aw, is shnookums not feeling schtimuwated?
	Nibbler	An understatement, to say the least. It's time you treated me with respect.
	Leela	If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides, and no more dressing ypu up in your cute little sailor suit.
	Nibbler	I keep telling you, that's my real naval uniform.
	Kif	Your place or mine?
	Amy	Both, but first, this place. [She drags him to the floor. Kif laughing nervously the entire time.]
	Hedonism Bot	[Seeing the two of them.] Ooh! Room for one more? [He laughs saucily.]
	Amy	I thought I set you for 7:15!
	Alarm Clock	Sorry, I hooked up with Bender last night. Dude was all over my snooze button.
	Amy	But my doctoral exam is in ten minutes! On Mars! [She runs out of bed but steps in something.] Eww! Kif, did you yack on the floor?
	Kif	[He is the puddle Amy walked in.] Yes, I did.
	Morris Katz	Where's your candidate, Farnsworth. I have a long list of students to humiliate today. [A door opens and Kif, Leela, Bender, Fry and Amy walk in.] You're late, Miss Wong.
	Amy	Oh, God, this is like one of those nightmares. [She is in only her bra and underpants. She screams.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Here, take my lab coat. [He offers it to her. He only has suspenders and his underpants underneath it.]
	Katz	Allow me to introduce your examining committee in order of grumpiness. Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
	Farsnworth	Wernstrom!
	Katz	Downtown Professor of Applied Physics, Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate.
	Tate	I see by your curriculum vit√¶ that you're a Sagittarius.
	Katz	And Professor Fisherprice Shpeekenshpell.
	Shpeekenshpell	The cow says... Moo.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[Whispering to Bubblegum.] He proved that 50 years ago, and he's been coasting on it ever since.
	Katz	I am the esteemed Professor Morris Katz, and you are wasting my time. Proceed.
	Amy	Imagine, if you will...
	Katz	Oh, God!
	Amy	A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy, because it's in essential Perpetual Motion.
	Wermstrom	[He and Katz scoff, loudly] Young lady, have you been drinking?
	Amy	Well, yes, but that's not revelant. I'm talking about Earth. Earth's the generator. [Shpeekenshpell lands on a sheep and makes a bleating noise.] Suppose this basketball is the whole world.
	Tate	[He is spinning a basketball on his finger.] To many young men in the inner city, it is.
	Amy	As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field. If we could use that field to generate electrical current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener... Ener... '[She sneezes.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, the Earth's rotational ener-kerchoo. Go on.
	Amy	Sorry, I'm super-allergic to cats. Professor Katz, do you mind.
	Katz	Miss Wong, I mind everything.
	Amy	[Holding a model.] You just need to polarize the Earth's core with a huge static charge, [The cat starts toying with the model.] by ratcheting Superconducting wire down into... [She sneezes.]
	Katz	Enough. The committee members will now vote now vote yea or nay. Nay.
	Wernstrom	Nay.
	Tate	Hell nay.
	Shpeekenshpell	[He spins to a Horse.] The horse says, doctorate denied.
	Fry	It's okay, Amy. I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field. [After they leave the hanger, Katz's cat leaves the ship.]
	Nibbler	Now that I am a full and equal member of the crew, I pledge my loyalty, my perspicacity, and, dare I say it, my friendship.
	Hermes	Leela, muzzle that skunk! We can't stop a meeting for some cute, fuzzy, little... [He notices Katz's cat.]] Hey, look, a kitty cat.
	Amy	[The cat rubs against Amy. Static discharges.] You again? [She sneezes.] Get away you mangy ball of Histamines.
	Hermes	[He picks the cat up.] You leave kitty cat alone! [The crew, except for Amy and Nibbler gather around, cooing at the cat.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	People, please, I'm trying to run a business, so I get to hold kitty. [The crew keeps cooing.]
	Fry	Over here. I wanna hold him.
	Bender	Aw! It's anus looks like an asterisk.
	Leela	Captain Fuzzytoes reporting for duty. I mean, cutie. [They laugh.]
	Nibbler	[Smoking a pipe.] My best friend died in that uniform. I hate that cat!
	Amy	If I had a spray bottle, I'd give him such a spritzing.
	Nibbler	I'll tell you one thing. Nothing acts that cute without some ulterior motive. [He gets up and does a small dance, cooing in discomfort.]
	Amy	Aw! You want your diapey changed? [He coos an affirmative.]
	Nibbler	[Laying down.] We'll have to wait its every move. [Amy puts on a fresh diaper.] Powder, please.
	Amy	Here's my new theory. That is one adorable cat.
	Nibbler	I guess I was just jealous. I do miss being Leela's schnookums. I'm going to apologize and hope for a pity pet. [They look over and gasp.]
	Leela	[She is kneeling before the cat.] Yes, my lord. Amy and Nibbler are a tewwible thweat. They must be spayed and neutered, wespectivewy. [Nibbler crouches and hisses like a cat.]
	Amy	[She runs into the meeting room, carrying Nibbler.] The cat is evil! We have proof!
	Nibbler	It was summoning a saucer!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Of course it was wanted a saucer you idiot. A saucer of dewicious cweam. [He has a gray cat in his lap.]
	Nibbler	You fool, this isn't about the cream.
	Bender	It's pwonounced "cweam". [He also has a cat, in his chest cabinet.]
	Zoidberg	I'm petting mine to the bone. [He strokes a cat, causing hair to be chopped off.]
	Fry	Just stwoke its fwffy fur.
	Hermes	Scwatch its fwubby chin.
	Bender	Fweeble its fwooby pwow.
	Amy	No, no! [She sneezes and flees with Nibbler.]
	Nibbler	What do cats need with that much yarn and cobalt?
	Amy	They're doing something downstairs. We've got to find out what. [She follows her coworkers.]
	Bender	Where do you think you're going, no-cat?
	Amy	Uh, the basement. I think I left the air hockey table on.
	Bender	Without a cat, you ain't going nowhere. [He points to a sign that says "All employeez must haz catz to enter".]
	Nibbler	Can you at least tell us what's going on down there?
	Prof. Farnsworth	We're certainly not building something sinister, if that's what your implying. Now, come on, Bender. Something sinister won't build itself. [They walk into the elevator.]
	Amy	Professor Katz's last name is Katz. Do you think he has something to do with these cats?
	Nibbler	The conclusion is an inescapable as it is moronic. [He wheels out his spaceship.] I say we pay him a visit, and if he won't talk to us, he'll talk to Smith & Wesson, [He pulls out a hand gun.] or, perhaps, [[Consolidated Head Melter. [He takes out a huge blaster. He and Amy get into the ship and it takes off.]
	Amy	[She knocks on the door then kicks it in.] Professor Katz, we want answers! [Katz just sits in his chair, with his back to them.]
	Nibbler	I warn you, if I have to get cute, it's gonna get ugly. [Katz still doesn't respond. Amy turns the chair.]
	Amy	He's dead!
	Nibbler	Wait. What are these strings on his lap? [He pulls them and Katz reacts.] What the... He isn't dead. He's one of those dog-operated puppets that's been adapted for use by a cat!
	Amy	So I had my doctorate denied by that fuzzball? [She shoots a picture of the cat.] Bad kitty!
	Amy	They actually built the planetary ratchet from my thesis! [The remaining crew are operating the ratchet, supervised by cats. Amy sneezes.] Uh-oh.
	Nibbler	What the... [Leela is standing in front of them. She kicks the weapons out of their hands.]
	Thubanian Leader	Well, look what the me dragged in.
	Nibbler	You can talk!
	Thubanian Leader	You can talk?
	Nibbler	How ironic. Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be simple house pets!
	Thubanian leader	Say, do you know Obliteron? He pretends to be a hamster, but when...
	Amy	Yeah, that really great. Could you please tell us what's going on?
	Thubanian leader	What? Oh, right! You see, my associates and I are from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban. Long ago, life there was ideal. [Flashback [A cat is leaping from scratching posts.] Our sun provide plenty of warm, dozy light. The chicken-salmon roamed free. [Cats pounce on the animals.] Yet disaster loomed. Our planet's rotation was gradually slowing. [Cats are sleeping at night and at day.] At first, it seemed beneficial. Long, dark nights for sleeping, long, sunny days for sleeping. But them it grew too hot and too cold. [Cats are meowing in pain, surrounded by fires. Then they are freezing under piles of snow.] Our top scientists went to work, [Cats are looking through a telescope.] At last, they located a planet with the necessary orientation and magnetic orientation to harness the rotational energy. [The telescope focuses on Earth. End Flashback.]
	Nibbler	Earth!
	Thubanian leader	Indubitably. Although we call it Blue Blue Shiny Ball. [Flashback to [[Egypt, 3,500 B.C. A saucer lands and cats get out, meowing. The Egyptians look surprised.] In the area now known as Egypt, my people constructed a giant, semi-octahedral antenna to beam Earth's rotational energy back to Thuban. [Egyptians are seen building a pyramid.]
	Amy	The Great Pyramid at Giza!
	Thubanian leader	Yes. The Egyptians viewed us as gods, but ironically that was our downfall. [The cats are surrounded by golden statues and are being fed by the Egyptians.] They pampered us with feasts most fancy and vittles most tender. We grew fat and domesticated. [A fat cat is napping on someone's lap. The cat meows a "Duh"] Thousands of years passed, and our home world was nearing total destruction. [From space, cats can be heard meowing on Thuban. A man the next planet over yells at them to shut up.] But the technology to save our planet was lost. Lost, that is, until I heard you speak at "Mars University".
	Amy	So you called my thesis a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it?
	Thubanian leader	Welcome to Academia.
	Nibbler	He intends to siphon off Earth's rotational energy!
	Amy	Earth will come to a stop, and...
	Thubanian leader	Half of you will cook, and half of you will freeze. Earth will become one big McDLT. We just got that commercial last year.
	Amy	Oh, yeah, smarty paws? You may have built the ratchet but you can't reach the core without 4,000 miles of superconducting wire. [She gasps.] The ball of yarn! [Cats are unraveling the "yarn" and it is being ratcheted down.]
	Thubanian leader	Quite.
	Nibbler	Even so, you would still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process.
	Thubanian leader	Ever had a cat rub up against you?
	Nibbler	If you're propositioning me, I'm not interested.
	Thubanian leader	I'm talking about the charge generated when 50,000 felines rub against a single surface. Professor?
	Thubanian leader	Soon the world will come to stop, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The stopping of the world, that is. It's unstoppable. [He gives an evil laugh.] Excuse me. [He starts chewing on his paw.]
	Thubanian leader	The Earth is coming to a stop. Keep you eyes on the kitties and push! [The crew are being entranced by the sight of cats playing.]
	Nibbler	[Locked in a pet carrier with Amy.] These space cats seem to be employing a form of hypnotic hyper-cuteness. Well, two can play that game. And one of them is me. [He puts on a face and starts cooing.]
	Leela	Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle? [The hypnotized crew stop and looks at Nibbler.]
	Thubanian leader	Mr. Winkles, Smudge-Smudge. Quick, dance with each other.
	Nibbler	Aw! [He shakes himself.] Damn, they are good.
	Thubanian leader	We're coming to a full stop. All cats, to your posts!
	Calculon	Catastrophe Beach Party. Scene One. Cue disaster effects, and action! [The entire studio gets through through the air. The walls of the building fly off and the letters to the "Hollywood" sign follow. A man screams while shooting away.]
	Calculon	Cut! That extra looked at the camera. We'll have to do it again.
	Thubanian leader	And now to transfer your planet's rotational energy to my home world. [He pulls a lever and a large amount of energy blast from the pyramids into space. It hits Thuban 9 and the planet starts spinning.]
	Thubanian	[Seeing their planet start to rotate.] Well, now, this calls for a celebration. [All the Thubanians nearby start to Can-can.
	Hermes	What's all this cat hair doing on my sweater? [He rubs at the "H" on his sweater and it dissipates.]
	Bender	And why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls?
	Nibbler	You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats.
	Thubanian leader	[The Thubanians are leaving.] Enjoy being broiled alive by the Sun and also the dead bird we've left in your slipper. [He laughs then leaves.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Quickly! If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth. [The ratchet won't move.]
	Hermes	It won't turn. Push harder, Bender!
	Bender	I can't. You should have called my cousin, Turner.
	Amy	It's hopeless. Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction.
	Fry	Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here.
	Bender	[He opens a window and gets hit by flames.] Is that better?
	Amy	Shmezzus, it's hot! Why'd I have to invent that awful device?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. It's how it's used. Like the death ray.
	Amy	Maybe you're right. I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that... [She gasps.] That's it! Pushing forward! Professor, I know how to restart the Earth.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[He scoffs.] You can't suddenly know something just by assembling a committee of words. [He gasps.] That's it. I'll assemble your committee!
	Amy	The ratchet won't turn backwards, but what if we kept pushing it forward? [She demonstrates on the hologram.] Earth would start turning again.
	Wernstrom	Yes, the wrong direction! [He laughs.]
	Amy	So?
	Tate	Gentlemen, [Sexfully.]ladies, [Normally.] let's get this globe trotting.
	Amy	[Reading a device.] It's working! Just a little faster!
	Zoidberg	But we're plotzing here!
	Amy	Then look at Nibbler! [Nibbler is in his naval uniform. He does a little dance. Everyone speeds up.]
	Thubanian Leader	[Addressing numerous other Thubanians.] On the whole, Earth's society is worthless. But they do these things called antique rugs that are great for peeing on. [Thuban 9 starts shaking as the rotational energy is returned to Earth. The cats go flying.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	And though the Earth is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough. Well done, Amy.
	Wernstrom	I'm honored to begrudgingly present you with your Ph.D. in applied physics.
	Tate	Also, some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment.
	Amy	Yay! I'm finally done with school. How's the job market?
	Shpeekenshpell	[He spins to a dog.] Ruff!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Congratulations, Dr. Wong!
	Kif	Congratulations.
	Nibbler	[Still dressing in his naval uniform.] Permission to come aboard?
	Leela	Granted, schnookums. [Nibbler climbs into Leela's lap and settles.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	You've got a bright future, Amy. As sure as the Sun sets in the east.
