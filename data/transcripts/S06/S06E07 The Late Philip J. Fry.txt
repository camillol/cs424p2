	Bender	Don't wake up Fry.
	Bender	My roommate's sleeping.
	Bender	Wake up already! [Fry wakes up and looks at Bender.] I'm about to get down and funky with this ladybot. And I'd appreciate it if as many people as possible could know about it. [They walk off to Bender's room.] [angry] Now can we get some privacy?
	Bender	Ah yeah, backing on up.
	Bender	[singing] Hambone! Hambone! Hambone. [talking] Okay, hambone break's over. Back to the bedroom.
	Bender	[off-screen; singing] Hambone! Hambone! Hambone.
	Bender	Wake up and feel the coffee.
	Fry	Oh no! I'm late for work again!
	Fry	Sorry, I'm late.
	Bender	Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I've had it with your tardiness, Fry. I expect you to arrive the same time as everyone else.
	Fry	Well, wait a second. Leela's not here yet.
	Amy	She left a while ago. She said some idiot were taking her to lunch for her birthday.
	Fry	Oh no! I'm late.
	Elzar	Since you got stood up, I thought this might cheer you up a notch.
	Leela	That's not necessary.
	Elzar	[singing] What day is today?It's Leela's birthday
	Leela	Please stop.
	Elzar	[singing] What a day for a birthday
	Leela	I really would like you to stop singing.
	Elzar	[singing] Let's all have some cake. [talking] You want to buy a slice of a birthday cake for 11.95?
	Leela	Yes, please.
	Fry	Ooh, nice cake. Sorry, I'm late.
	Leela	[angry] Where have you—? [calm] Nah, it's fine.
	Fry	You're not mad?
	Leela	I was. But then I realised it's actually my fault for thinking you might be on time for once. [She cleans her mouth with a napkin.] Anyhow, I ate both our lunches. You ordered the Lobster Pilé. It wasn't cheap.
	Elzar	Bam!
	Fry	Please, let me make it up to you. I'll treat you to a fancy birthday dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.
	Leela	Wow. That'll be the nicest place I've ever been stood up.
	Fry	Not this time. No matter what happens, I'll swear I be there.
	Bender	Guys, guys! Hedonism bot is finally settling down and marrying a nice house in the suburb. [He is holding an announcement of Hedonism together with his house with the text 'I'm Getting Married!'.] But tonight, he's having the girls gone wildest bachelor party of all time.
	Fry	Woohoohoohoo... [He notices Leela is not pleased.] ... cares? I'm having dinner with Leela.
	Leela	Just go to your stupid party. We can have dinner on my birthday some other year.
	Fry	No. I can throw up on a stripper anytime. Tonight, I wanna not throw up. On you.
	Leela	Really?
	Bender	Your loss. [He turns around. Farnsworth and Cubert are in the laboratory.] Hey, Professor, you're my wingman.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Very well. Eh, Cubert, fetch my drinking teeth.
	Fry	I just have to sign Leela's birthday card. How do you spell XO?
	Amy	Guh. It's a record your own message card. You don't sign it. You leave it nude video greetings.
	Fry	Does it have to be nude?
	Amy	I guess not. That never occurred to me.
	Fry	If I leave now, record a birthday greeting on the way, score some fancy cologne at the newsstand, I'll be exactly on time!
	Prof. Farnsworth	You're not going anywhere.
	Fry	But I have a date.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You were late this morning. So you'll have to stay and test my latest invention. [They walk over to a giant sheet covering something. He reveals a time travelling machine.] Behold! A time travelling machine!
	Bender	Time? I can't go back there.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, but this time machine only goes forward in time. That way you can't accidentally change history. Or do something disgusting like sleep with your own grandmother.
	Fry	I wouldn't wanna do that again.
	Prof. Farnsworth	We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute. [He takes out a remote and opens the time machine. The sound of a car being unlock is heard.] Get in.
	Fry	Okay, hurry. Let's get it over with. I can record Leela's birthday card while we're in there.
	Fry	[to card] Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, because we're testing the professor's dumb time machine.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Okay. I'll just nudge us forward exactly one minute into the—
	Fry	My card!
	Fry	Did we go too far? What time is it?
	Bender	[dramatically] The year ten thousand!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[voice over] Whoopsie.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh dear. I mean, oh my.
	Fry	The year ten thousand? But I promised Leela I'll be on time for dinner.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Relax, Fry. Everyone we ever knew died thousands of years ago.
	Bender	Everyone we ever knew? Nah, I never liked those guys.
	Fry	[frustrated] No! They did it! They blew it up! [The camera pans to reveal a monkey Statue of Liberty.] And then the apes blew up their society too. How could this happen? [Camera pans to reveal a bird Statue of Liberty.] And then the birds took over and ruined their society. [Camera pans to reveal a cow Statue of Liberty.] And then the cows. And then... [Camera pans to reveal a strange slug-like Statue of Liberty.] ... I don't know, is that a slug, maybe? [screaming] Noooo!
	Waiter	While you await your [He does a quotation mark hand gesture.] friend. Allow me to read from a prepared history of our cavern. [He takes out a brochure titled 'History of Cavern on the Green'.] These unique rock formations were created over millions of years by mineral rich water dripping from pores in the ceiling. Dripping and dripping. [voice slowed down into a dark tone] year on year, [even slower] century after century.
	Elzar	[singing] What day is today? [talking] Hey, aren't you the loser who got stood up on my other restaurant?
	Leela	Just shut up and bring me two dinners.
	Leela	Has anyone seen Fry's ass? It's late for a date with my boot.
	Cubert	Fry's not here. Obviously he went to that pervert party with Bender and the professor.
	Leela	Fry went to the party?
	Linda	[on television] We interrupt Hypnotoad on Ice to bring you breaking coverage ... [The title card reads 'Sorrow at the soirée'.] ... of the disaster at Hedonism bot's bachelor party.
	Morbo	[on television] Linda, what began as innocent fun ended in tragedy tonight when a nuclear powered robot stripper suffered a catastrophic reactor meltdown. There is only one survive.
	Hedonism Bot	Everywhere I looked there were piles of bodies. And then the explosion struck.
	Zoidberg	The three coworkers I like... all dead!
	Leela	Fry stood me up and died? [angry] I'm so angry. [sad] I mean, I'm so sad. [angry] But I'm still pretty angry. [sad] But also sad. [to Hermes] Can I be both?
	Hermes	It's what he'd want.
	Leela	Then that's what I am! Hi-yah!
	Bender	Man, the future is a total craphole. Whoever lives here is a crapface sack of crap. [He turns around to some natives.] No offence, fellows.
	Native #1	Don't sweat it, man.
	Fry	I'll never see Leela again.
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, without a backwards time machine we're stuck in this craphole.
	Native #1	Dude, give it a rest.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hold on! I got it. We can't go back in time, but we can keep going forward until people invent the backwards time machine.
	Fry	And then we can go home.
	Bender	Hit it.

	Old Hermes	Sometimes I can't believe how successful Planet Express became once the professor was killed and you seized control.
	Old Leela	There were tough times. But we all pulled together.
	Old Zoidberg	I've been crunching the numbers on our transgalactic strategy—
	Old Leela	What are you doing here? I laid you off twenty years ago.
	Old Zoidberg	Oh, the claws can't flee like they used to.
	Old Leela	Success is nice, but I do kinda miss the old days.
	Old Cubert	Hey, leels.
	Old Leela	Hi, Cubert.
	Male inhabitant	May we help you, strange ones?
	Bender	We are travellers from the past, my good runt.
	Female inhabitant	I see, since your time, human evolution has diverged.
	Male inhabitant	There are we; advanced in intellect and morality.
	Female inhabitant	And the Dumblocks; stupid viscous brutes, who live underground.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Advanced in intellect, you say? Have you invented a backwards time machine?
	Female inhabitant	No, but if we supply our superior minds, we can perfect such a device within five years.
	Prof. Farnsworth	See you then!
	Bender	We're back for our time machine.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yuhoo, boys! What's this era in human history like?
	Soldier #1	The machines, we build them to make our lives easier, but they rebelled. They won't stop until every human is dead.
	Bender	This seems like a nice future. Let's just stay here. We can settle down on that mountain of skulls.
	Bender	Hey! That place had a gorgeous view of Blood Lake.
	Lady #1	Greetings, time travellers.
	Bender	Stupid jerks wouldn't let me stay in the good future.
	Fry	How do you know we're time travellers?
	Lady #2	We too studied the time travel enigma.
	Lady #3	We have perfected a method using negative mass neutrino fields that allow us to travel backwards in time.
	Prof. Farnsworth	My name is Hubert.
	Fry	[joyous] All right! We can go home!
	Bender	[mocking] Nah-nah! We can go...
	Lady #1	We can talk about our research tomorrow. Men are very rare in our society. Even very old and stupid males are priced. [Farnsworth and Fry smiles.] Tonight, please be the guests of honour at our fertility banquet.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, there is certainly no harm in a fertility banquet.
	Fry	I can eat. And fertilise.
	Lady #1	Very well, anoint our guests in oil without using our hands.
	Bender	[interrupting] Oh, so we can stay in the future you like? But not the future I like? Next!
	Prof. Farnsworth	No! I was about to close the deal.
	Fry	Bender, they had a backwards time machine.
	Bender	The other place had a lot of good things too. Did you even see that mountain of skulls?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Why you!
	Bender	Oh no, you didn't.
	Fry	Stop. Somewhere, some time, Leela's waiting for me. We need to keep looking for a backwards time machine.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Fry is right.
	Bender	Yes, we have to work together. And not have this fight I was definitely winning.
	Prof. Farnsworth	The year one billion.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I got a feeling this could be exactly the point in time we've been looking for. [This future is entirely covered in a dead desert, covering as far as the eyes can see.] Nope. [Farnsworth takes up a device that scans the area and turns up an X on its screen and buzzes.] In fact, all life is extinct.
	Fry	So let's keeping going forward.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, it's no use. Earth is dead. This is the end of all things.
	Fry	The Cavern on the Green.
	Fry	I made it, Leela. Sorry, I'm a billion years late.
	Old Leela	You'll get your alimony cheque, Cubert. Now get lost.
	Old Cubert	Chill out, I'm just here to see Amy.
	Old Amy	Move it, boy-toy. Granny's taking you to Atlantic City.
	Old Hermes	I don't know why you ever married that pig-nose punk.
	Old Leela	I don't know either. I'm married to the job now. [The faint reveal of the time machine appears behind Leela and the birthday card comes flying out.] I used to think there was someone for me, but— [She gets hit by the card and falls over.] Aw! [She sits up with the card.] How odd, it's one of those old record your own message birthday cards.
	Fry	[on card] Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, because we are testing the professor's dumb time machine. But you know, happy birthday and all and... [He leans closer to the card.] ... I love you. [In the background, the time machine goes off. The card vanishes away from Fry] My card!
	Old Leela	My whole life I've been mad at him. And it wasn't his fault.
	Leela	[voice-over] Dear Fry, our time together was short, but it was the best time of my life.
	Fry	You know, all in all, I had a good life. What you say the three of us grab a six pack and watch the universe end?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hear, hear!
	Bender	That's basically what I do every day.
	Fry	To the end of the universe.
	Fry	So long, Earth. Thanks for the air and whatnot.
	Fry	Hey, uh, what was the purpose of life anyway?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Who knows? Probably some hogwash about the human spirit.
	Bender	Mm-hm.
	Fry	Sounds about right.
	Prof. Farnsworth	The stars are receding. Oh, the vast emptiness.
	Bender	Yeah, yeah, I can take a hint.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, the last protons should be decaying about now.
	Fry	Bye, last proton.
	Prof. Farnsworth	And... [He stands up.] ... here we are; the end of the universe.
	Fry	Well, now what? You guys wanna talk?
	Bender	No thanks.
	Fry	Did anyone else see that?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Unbelievable. It's a second big bang. [In front of them, the sun is forming. Fry is covering his eyes.] My God, is it possible?
	Fry	It must be possible. It's happening. By the way, what's happening?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It appears, this universe is exactly identical to the old one. If so, we just need to keep going forward in time to the point when we left. [The Earth is forming in front of them. Volcanoes and ashes covers the surface.] The Earth is born! [It begins raining. A rock hits the Earth and the moon appears.] Ladies and gentlemen, the moon.
	Fry	Look. The first fish to crawl up on land.
	Bender	[off screen] It was coming right at us.
	Bender	You saw it.
	Fry	I'm gonna grab another beer.
	Bender	Fry, Fry, you're missing the dinosaurs.
	Fry	It's okay. They're not going anywhere. [He finally retrieves a beer and stands up.] Where'd they go?
	Bender	Now what's going on there?
	Fry	History.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hang on, I just want to make one stop.
	Hitler	Betrachten Sie meinen Schnurrbart.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Easy. Easy. Taking her in for a landing.
	Prof. Farnsworth	One year to go. [He moves the switch.] Six months.
	Fry	I'm almost there, Leela.
	Prof. Farnsworth	One month. [He moves the switch.] Two weeks. [He moves the switch.] One hour. [He moves the switch.] Thirty seconds and here we—
	Fry	Stop!
	Bender	Give me the keys, Magoo.
	Prof. Farnsworth	We'll have to bring her around again.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Just slow it down, I'll shoot Hitler out the window. [He takes out his weapon again and aims out the window and shoots.] Darn! I shot Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake. [He drops the weapon.] Okay. Nearing our era again. [Bender moves the leaver.] Here we go. [Bender moves the leaver.] Careful this time. [Bender moves the leaver.] Careful.
	New Farnsworth	We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute. [He opens the time machine with his remote.] Get in.
	New Fry	Okay, hurry, let's get it over with.
	New Farnsworth	But, err, wha–?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh uh.
	Prof. Farnsworth	This new universe is about ten feet lower than our old one.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Pow. We took care of the time travel paradox.
	Fry	All right!
	Bender	Yabba dabba doo.
	Fry	Oh uh, I'm late for dinner with Leela.
	Waiter	Welcome to Cavern on the Green. May I offer you some meatloaf while you wait?
	Fry	Sorry, I'm late.
	Leela	Actually, you're on time.
	Fry	Really?
	Leela	I have to admit, I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
	Fry	That was the old Fry. He's dead now.
	Fry	Happy birthday, Leela. I got you a card, but I guess I kinda lost it.
	Leela	That's okay. I don't really like cards. What I'll remember is our time together.
