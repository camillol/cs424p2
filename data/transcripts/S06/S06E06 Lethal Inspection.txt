	Professor Farnsworth	[Groans] I fear I may not survive this war reenactment. We’re only twelve feet from the parking lot.
	Fry	[standing in mud, surrounded by flies] This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War.
	Leela	Not the Civil War private. We’re reinacting the Sith-il War. [She points to a plaque that says “Sith Invasion of 2865 Historic Site]
	Fry	Sith? What the Hoth?
	Bender	Enemy invaders! Up in yonder sky!
	Darth Stroyer	I am Darth Stroyer.
	Fry	Darth Stroyer? That’s the stupidest name I’ve ever heard.
	Leela	Let’s hear the rest.
	Darth Trocious	Darth Trocious.
	Darth Sploder	Darth Sploder.
	Darth Urderer	Darth Urderer.
	Darth Ithead	Darth Ithead. [His lightsaber malfunctions and he has to turn it back on]
	Leela	Company! Attack!
	Hermes	Don’t fire until you see the greens of their eyes! It saves on bullets.
	Darth Stroyer	I shall rip out your heart and show it to you! [touches Scruffy with a lightsaber] It is done.
	Scruffy	The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long. [He lays on the ground and acts dead.] Mhrm.
	Darth Sploder	You're dead!
	Professor Farnsworth	No, I'm just very old. [He makes choking noises and falls down]
	Darth Sploder	[He taps the Professor with his foot and gets no response.] Woah! That good acting!
	Fry	It's payback time, Sploder! [Fry's gun fires a beam that tags Sploder then falls flat. Fry presses a button on his gun and the beam retracts.]
	Darth Sploder	Tell my mother... to pick me up outside Quiznos.
	Hermes	[Wheeling his desk up] That's three dead. Uh-oh. Let's pick up the pace, people. At this point in the actual war, the death toll was ninety-eight million. [He gestures towards a large set of graves nearby]
	Bender	[Chuckles] You humans and your fragile organs. One little stab to the goo and [He blows a raspberry]
	Darth Trocious	[He lands on Bender and tags with the his lightsaber.] You're dead, Earth man!
	Bender	[Dramatically] Oh, cruel fate, I'm dead. They're putting me in my Sunday suit and shoving me in a wooden box. [He falls to the ground] Now they're loading me into cold, cold ground. Hello! Here come the worms! [He starts laughing]
	Fry	If you were really dead, you wouldn't be laughing so hard.
	Bender	Yeah, yeah. Death's a big deal to you flesh bags. But in case you didn't notice, I'm a robot.
	Fry	So? What if something heavy fell on you, like a church? You could still die.
	Bender	Nuh-uh! My wireless back-up unit saves a copy of me every day. So, if my body gets killed, big whoop, I just download into another body. I'm immortal, baby!
	Amy	What? Then how come you always scream so much when you're in danger?
	Bender	I never said I wasn't a drama queen.
	Hermes	And the winner of the war is... let me just cross check my tabulation here. Factor in the corsages for the widows.
	Bender	Hurry up, you number-crunching crumb-nuncher! Everybody but me is dying of old age!
	Hermes	Okay. The winners, at a net cost of only $12 per life cut tragically short, our Sith Overlords.
	Darth Sploder	Hot diggity! I mean... [Breathes like Darth Vader in his best basso profundo voice.] Supreme diggity.
	Fry	It may have been a fake war, but my scuffed knee is all too real.
	Professor Farnsworth	I have pain in joints I had removed a century ago. Bender, bring me my soft chair with the wheels on it.
	Bender	Your wheelchair?
	Professor Farnsworth	I don't need a wheelchair! The one with the wheels!
	Bender	Poor flimsy humans. Don't you wish you were flawless like me? A towering inferno of physical perfection?
	Leela	I hate to pop your blimp-like ego, but you're not perfect.
	Bender	Am so!
	Leela	Are not!
	Bender	Is too!
	Leela	Says who?
	Bender	Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect. [He takes a scrap of paper out of his chest cabinet and kisses it] Inspector 5, the best inspector a kid could want. The day I was built, he looked me over, probably with tears of pride in his eyes, and proclaimed to the world, by means of this scrap of paper, that I was perfect and infallible in every way!
	Professor Farnsworth	Hey, Mr. Perfect? You wet the chair. [He points to the oil stain on the wheelchair]
	Bender	Huh? Wasn't me. Must be some of that urine your all so proud of.
	Fry	[He tastes some of the puddle with his finger] That's not urine, it's oil.
	Bender	Impossible! I'm triple sealed to prevent any chance of ... [He looks behind him and shrieks. He is leaking oil.]
	Zoidberg	You call that an ink defense? [His coat tears off and he sprays ink everywhere and scuttles off] Goodbye, friends!
	Bender	What could have caused the leak? Excessive heat, on the count that I'm so hot?
	Professor Farnsworth	Alas, no. Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's a symptom of a fatal defect.
	Bender	Yeah, fatal schmatal. If I die I can just download my backup copy into my new, equally fabulous, body.
	Professor Farnsworth	That's just it! You can't. You were built without a backup unit.
	Bender	[He sits up, shocked] There's no backup copy of me?
	Professor Farnsworth	That's what I just said, you mortal coil.
	Bender	So, if I die...
	Professor Farnsworth	You die. Or as you put it [He blows a raspberry]
	Bender	[Nervous] Um, excuse me for a moment. [He unscrews his head and puts it into his chest cabinet] [muffled] No!
	Bender	I can't believe it! I'm gonna die.
	Fry	How much time does he have left, Professor?
	Professor Farnsworth	Between a minute and a billion years.
	Fry	[He puts his hand on Bender's shoulder] Well, at least you can plan accordingly.
	Bender	Dying sucks butt! How do you living beings cope with mortality?
	Leela	Violent outbursts.
	Amy	General sluttiness.
	Fry	Thanks to denial, I'm immortal.
	Bender	Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect. Inspector 5 gave me his blessing! [He pulls out his scrap of paper and looks at it] How could he bring me into this world knowing I was going to die?
	Zoidberg	So you wish you were never born, maybe?
	Bender	Yes, anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time!
	Zoidberg	Then suicide it is. Step into my office. I'll give you a nice Kervorking.
	Bender	Not until I hunt down Inspector 5 and beat an explanation out of him!
	Leela	I'm all for a good beating, but you'll never find him. Product inspectors are bureaucrats, faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork.
	Hermes	[While his shirt blends into the wall] I beg to differ!
	Bender	Stinking bureaucrats! I hate 'em.
	Leela	Then again, you might be able to find Inspector 5 with the help of another seasoned bureaucrat.
	Bender	Hermes, old pal!
	Hermes	Old pal? 8.5 seconds ago, you said you hated me.
	Bender	Time heals all wounds.
	Hermes	You know what? I will help you, but only to prove to you that I'm not a paper-pushing file-jockey.
	Amy	Will you be taking your portable filing cabinet?
	Hermes	None of your beeswax!
	Hermes	I'll only be gone for an hour, but I'm counting on you to do the all-critical filing in my absence. Shall we review alphabetical order. [He starts singing] A, B, C, D...
	Leela	[Shoving Hermes outside] Get out of my office!
	Old man	Yes. I'd like to request a death certificate. [He dies.]
	Woman	Sorry. That's Building C.
	Hermes	The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats. We should be able to look up Inspector 5.
	Man	[He scans Hermes' grade 36 badge then stamps three forms three times each.] Application for ingress approved. [He hands over a form] And the other potential entrant?
	Hermes	Uh, he's my pencil sharpener.
	Bender	You betcha! [He takes the man's pencil and sharpens it in his ass then hands it back]]
	Man	[While staring at the pencil] Proceed. [He picks up the pencil with tongs and drops it in a fire.]
	Hermes	I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways.
	Bender	Wow! Until now, I thought giant cubes were exciting.
	Bender	I did like the part where they screamed.
	Hermes	[Wheeling an escalator to his cubicle.]' This is mine. Right next to the center square.
	Center Square Guy	Sorry, Hermes. I drank all your white-out. [He laughs]
	Hermes	Once I log on, I can access Inspector 5's profile.
	Bender	[He sits in front of the computer and has his eye scanned. A buzzer sounds.] Damn it! It won't go on.
	Hermes	That's because you're not me. [He sits in front of the computer and begins working]
	Bender	Hooray! It won't go on!
	Hermes	The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone but the assigned bureaucrat log on. [He is scanned and his profile appears onscreen.]
	Computer	Identity confirmed. Also, you have a rectangular mass in your colon.
	Hermes	That's a calculator. I ate it to gain its power.
	Bender	You locate Inspector 5 while I slip into my ass-kicking feet. [He pulls a pair of foot-cups with spikes on them out of his chest cabinet and screws them on.]
	Hermes	[He gasps] Sweet File-not-found of Puget Sound! His record's been blanked!
	Bender	Aw, man! How am I going to find some anonymous guy I don't know anything about?
	Center Square Guy	I recommend the men's room of the TWA terminal. [He laughs and a red "X" appears on his desk]
	Leela	Okay. Just filing alphabetically. [She unscrews the container] A. B. C. D... [The message is in AL1. Well, this requires a little extra thought. [She looks around then hides the message behind a potted plant] I'm a natural.
	Hermes	The information we need will be here, in the physical files.
	Bender	[Rolling up his "sleeves"] Those bastards won't know what leafed through them. [Hermes opens the door and they run inside, looking around. There is only one filing cabinet with three drawers] It's on!
	Hermes	[He opens the drawer and it knocks Bender down. Hermes looks through the files.] No! This is impossible! Quit blacking out and look at this. Inspectors 1, 2, 3, 4... 6. There's no trace of Inspector 5!
	Bender	But 5's the one we want. Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3...
	Hermes	Addition never solve anything, man. Let's cut our losses and go home.
	Bender	So I'm doomed to die? And I'll never even get to punch whoever's responsible? Oh, what's the point. [He walks into a suicide booth]
	Hermes	Bender, no! Suicide isn't necessarily the answer!
	Bender	It's not a suicide booth, you lard-ass. It's a phone booth. [He closes the door]
	Hermes	They have phones in booths now? Finally, I don't have to lug this cellphone around. [He throws his cellphone into a trash bin]
	Bender	[He puts a coin on a string in the slot then pulls it out again. He dials a number]
	Mom	Who the hell is this? How did you get this number?
	Bender	Is this the robot company? Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot. His name is me!
	Mom	A defective robot, you say? [A monitor shows Bender in the phone booth with Hermes nearby.] Stay right there, dearie. [Cross-hairs appear over the phone booth] I'll have tech support take care of you. [She presses a button]
	Bender	[He exits the phone booth.] Well, things are starting to look up.
	Hermes	Look up! [They dive out of the way of a missile that explodes nearby.] Who did you call? Dial-a-bomb?
	Bender	No, I just told the robot company I was defective.
	Hermes	You dumb cocktail shaker! Mom won't allow a defective product to tarnish her good name! She'll kill you.
	Bender	Big whoop. I'll just download into a new... Oh, right. If I die, I die. Speaking of which– [Machine guns start shooting at them] You're right. You're right. You're right. [They run away]
	Mom	[Watching the Killbots on a monitor] That's what you get for calling technical support.
	Bender	I can't run anymore. I'll have to skip. [They skip off]
	Hermes	Just a few more feet. We have to get to that pile of dead bears by 7:38.
	Bender	A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing. But what?
	Hermes	It's the 7:38! Jump! [They both jump into a train car. The Killbots come up on the track next to it.
	Bender	Aw, shoot!
	Killbot	Someone said "shoot!" [They shoot and destroy the Killbot in the middle.
	Bender	Well, we're boned!
	Hermes	No, we're not! We just go to limbo!
	Bender	But I'm not design to bend that low, not without limbo music. [Bullet hit him creating a rhythm.] That'll do it. Ow! Ow! Ow!
	Killbot 1	We're gonna get fired.
	Killbot 2	Someone said "fire!" [He shoots kills Killbot 1, then is killed by the tunnel.]
	Bender	[His legs have been broken] We did it!
	Hermes	Twelve straight hours of limbo. I haven't done that since my honeymoon.
	Bender	Hermes! Hermes! Remember that flock of bats?
	Hermes	I sure do.
	Bender	That was fun.
	Bender	Where are we?
	Hermes	I have no idea.
	Bender	Hey. We're just a stone's throw away from Tijuana. [He picks up a stone and throws it over the border fence.] See?
	Mexican Man	¡Dios mio! A rock has fallen here in the outskirts of Tijuana.
	Bender	Is it within city limits?
	Mexican Man	I think, yes.
	Bender	Told you!
	Hermes	Hey, you wanna celebrate our escape? Maybe grab a shot of tequila and take in a big-league cockfight?
	Bender	Sure. No, wait. I was built in Tijuana. Maybe Inspector 5 still works there. He better do some splaining. Before I mash up some face guacamole.
	Bender	[Bender and Hermes walk up to a border checkpoint.] He's Mexican, I'm Mexican. Let me handle this. {The Border Patrolman says something in Spanish] ¡Si! [Bender gets hit on the head with a ukulele] Ouch-o!
	Hermes	[He pulls a minature filing cabinet out of his pocket.] Here are our passports, visas, and Homeland Security permission slips, notarized and starched.
	Mexican Border Patrolman	[He looks them over] Okay. I would also have accepted a bribe.
	Bender	Nice work, butterball. You know, I was in Italy last week. [He gasps]
	Bender	My birthplace. It's closed! There's not even a shrine to me. With a gift shop, selling piñatas of me!
	Hermes	End of the line, man! Come on, we can still catch a twi-night double cockfight.
	Bender	No wait! What's that in the Mexican garbage?
	Hermes	Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper.
	Bender	No, next to that. [He pulls out a book and shakes two owls off it] A half-eaten employee directory. [He opens it and gasps] Inspector 5's home address. His ass-ias is gracias!
	Bender	[He bursts through the door] Where are you hiding, you coward? Get out here and get murdered like a man!
	Hermes	[He closes the door] Bender, I'm afraid our search is at an end. He's obviously long gone.
	Bender	Oh yeah? Well, maybe this is him in a costume. [He picks up an iguana and begins squeezing it] I'm gonna squeeze you out of there like Tijuana toothpaste.
	Hermes	[He helps Bender up] Okay, Bender, you're mortal. And okay, Inspector 5 screwed up. But that just makes the time you have left all the more precious. Do you really want to waste the rest of your life in a bitter, homicidal rage?
	Bender	[While punching the wall] No! Yes! I don't know! [He punches the wall a few more times] Why? Why did he do this to me? All I wanted as a little quality control. But he didn't care enough. And now I gonna die. I deserve better! I'm Bender, damn it! I'm Bender! [He starts crying]
	Hermes	There, there, mon. It's gonna be okay. You are Bender, which is something Inspector 5 will never be.
	Bender	You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing, [Hermes clears his throat] Oh. No offense, Hermes. You're not like that. I mean, you're exactly like that, but you're okay! In fact, I'm putting you on the do-no-kill list. [Hermes smiles] Come on, fellow mortal. We're in Tijuana. I wanna live a little. [An explosion happens outside, blowing a window in.] Help, I'm gonna die! That's the opposite of what I want!
	Hermes	[He goes to the computer] Quick, run out the back! I hack into Inspector 5's terminal and fake your death, so they'll call of the Killbots.
	Bender	You know that terminal's unhackable! I'm not leaving you, and that's final! [An explosion rips the roof of the house] Good luck, buddy!
	Computer	Bender, terminated.
	Hermes	Bender saved.
	Killbot 2	Cease fire. Mom called off the attack, although I don't see how it's her–
	Killbot 3	Someone said "howitzer!" [Killbots 1 and 3 start firing on the middle Killbot, eventually blowing themselves up.]
	Bender	Yeah! All right! Yeah! [The house collapses. Bender groans and wipes away a tear. Hermes limbos out from under the wreckage.] He did it! And he's not even looking back at that cool explosion! He's a hero!
	Amy	What's happening? The phone's been disconnected, the ship's been repossessed, and Zoidberg's getting overcooked! [Scruffy is cooking Zoidberg on a spit.]
	Bender	[He and Hermes walk in wearing sombreros.] Ah. This place never changes.
	Hermes	Leela! What in the name of Jah happened?
	Leela	Too much papers! Not enough hiding plants!
	Hermes	It's alright. This place just needs a one-hour bureauatizing.
	Leela	[As Hermes shovels the last of the paperwork into a furnace.] You make it look so easy.
	Hermes	I've smoked a lot of paperwork in my day.
	Fry	Hey, Bender. Did you ever find that inspector guy you were looking for?
	Bender	[Putting his arm around Hermes] Nah, but thanks to this knucklehead, I did find a new outlook on life. It's precious and sacred, and you only get so many millions of years on this Earth. So let's get brick-faced! [Everyone cheers. Everyone but Hermes runs off]
	Hermes	[He looks around then throws a folder into the fire. The front burns away, revealing Inspector 5 to be Hermes.]
