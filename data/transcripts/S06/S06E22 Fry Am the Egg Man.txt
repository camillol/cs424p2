	Fry	Run, Leela! They're bouncing right at us!
	Bender	So... Anybody hungry?
	Fry	I could stuff myself.
	Leela	I'll use that free app that tells you what restaurants you're near.
	Fry	You mean the window?
	Leela	Yes.
	Lrrr	[angry] I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8! I demand extra dipping sauce!
	Teenaged Alien	How many?
	Lrrr	[shy] Uh... Two.
	Fishy Joe	Welcome to Fishy Joe's. Today is Stroganoff Thursday. We are currently out of the following menu items.
	Female voice	Stroganoff.
	Teenaged Alien	May I take your order?
	Fry	I'll have the Stroganoff.
	Teenaged Alien	Okay.
	Bender	Yeah, uh, gimme the fried spaghetti dinner breakfast pocket for lunch an', uh, a big bucket o' mixed sodas.
	Teenaged Alien	One kids meal. Got it.
	Leela	[off camera] Huh. Buggalo tots?
	Leela	What exactly are those made of?
	Teenaged Alien	You got a warrant?
	Leela	I'll just have something from the lite menu. How about the gardener lover's salad?
	Teenaged Alien	What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
	Leela	Ugh! Just gimme the fruit cup!
	Teenaged Alien	Okey-doke. What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
	Leela	Oh, God! Fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T. And it's got quotation marks around it.
	Fry	Mmm. There's nothin' wrong with a little fast food once or twice a meal. Heart... Attack! I'm fine.
	Leela	Oh! I got a bone in my fruit! That's it. From now on, we're not eating anything unless we know what it is an' where it's from. We're going to the local farmers market.
	Bender	Aw, mom! Do we hafta?!
	Leela	This is what I'm talkin' about! See all the dirt an' earwigs? That's the sign of healthy food.
	Hydroponic farmer	You think that's healthy? Try this. I found it growin' at the bottom of my hamper.
	Leela	Mmm! So fresh an' musty!
	Bulb	It's what I do.
	Thog	Hello, tiny man. You want sample small-batch Amazonian maple syrup?
	Fry	Sure. That's the kinda sap I like.
	Thog	You the kind of sap I like.
	Fry	I'm scaroused!
	Bender	Zuban tobacco?! The richest, most obnoxious kind! Listen, pal. I'm lookin' for a versatile smoke. One that's equally good in a crowded elevator or an audience with the Pope.
	Moustached Alien	Forget the Pope, my friend. Smoke one of these and God himself will ask to be seated far away from you.
	Bender	Ooh!
	Leela	Heirloom eggs?! That's so life-affirming! I'll bet you run your own hatchery. Just you and your wife... Matilda.
	Brown-haired man	No, ma'am. Matilda an' I gather them eggs in the forest. And Matilda's really more of a mongoose than a wife.
	Leela	You're a lucky man. But are they way more expensive than regular eggs?
	Brown-haired mMan	Way more.
	Leela	Ooh! I'll take a dozen.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wha?! You're not my breakfast friends! What are you doing here?!
	Amy	Leela blackmailed us all into eating healthy, organic food.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Blackmail? What does she have on you?
	Hermes	As long as we eat 'er filthy scrambled eggs, you'll never find out.
	Leela	They're not filthy! They're wholesome, fertile, and fresh from the forest floor. There's some filth.
	Fry	FERTILE? What does that mean?
	Zoidberg	It means it'll hatch into a tiny, little infant creature. Unless we cook it first. Hey, Leela! Hurry up with those scrambled infants!
	Fry	What?! That's horrifying! Zoidberg, you're an in-Human monster.
	Zoidberg	What are you? My driver's license?
	Fry	Eating a sweet, innocent chick before it's even hatched?! Oh-ho-ho-ho, no, you won'tn't! I refuse to eat an unborn animal! I'm gonna keep this egg safe and warm and secure. Until it hatches out into the world. And then I'm gonna eat it!
	Leela	Should we turn on the TV?
	Hermes	Nah.
	Fry	Bender, d'you mind? I'm roosting.
	Bender	I'm considerin' buyin' a yacht to house my Thoroughbreds. How d'you expect me to do that without smokin' a cigar?
	Fry	Think of the unborn embryo!
	Bender	That's what I'm gonna call the yacht. Stop pickin' me! Whoa!
	Fry	Hey! Leggo my egg-o, crab-o!
	Hermes	Stop it, Fry! That's sexual harassment!
	Zoidberg	Yeah, come down off your round, white pulpit! You're just gonna eat that thing, anyway!
	Fry	I was, but you can't sit on something for a week without falling in love with it. Whoever's in here deserves a chance at life. A chance to blossom into a beautiful young man. Like I did as a baby. And so I make this solemn vow... To do everything I can to make sure this wonderful, innocent creature enters this world happy, healthy, an'— All yours, Zoidberg.
	Bender	Aw! Look at the cute, little— I was gonna go yachting in those feet!
	Leela	Relax, you babies. It's no different from stomping a puppy.
	Fry	Everyone stop! He's not gonna hurt you.
	Bender	I'm standin' in a pool of my own feet!
	Hermes	Bender's right! Kill it before someone names it!
	Fry	No! Mr. Peppy just wants to be our friend.
	Hermes	Oy!
	Fry	Look: I know 'e's ugly and kinda corrosive, but we can't murder someone just 'cause he's hideous an' annoying.
	Amy	That's what we said about Zoidberg and look what that got us.
	Zoidberg	Amy has a point.
	Fry	Mr. Peppy's not like Zoidberg. He's my friend.
	Zoidberg	Aw!
	Calculon	Where to... Adulterers?
	Monique	Calculon?! Then it wasn't your body they found in the harbor after the bomb went off.
	Calculon	What bomb?
	Bender	It takes more than that to surprise me, Bender. [Mr. Peppy, who has gotten bigger, suddenly appears. Bender screams, scared.] What you doin', little buddy? Uh, yeah... Uncle Bender... He's your friend. [Mr. Peppy stands up, which scares Bender even more. Bender screams effeminately as Mr. Peppy faces him with an angry look. Mr. Peppy then vomits a tennis ball on the couch.] Huh? Oh, you wanna play fetch! [Bender grabs the ball and Mr. Peppy begins panting and wagging his tail.] Come on, boy! Get the ball. [Bender pretends to throw the ball, making a barking Mr. Peppy run, only to find nothing, and laughs.] Dumb jerk. Come on! Get the ball.
	Hermes	Sweet freak of Mozambique! That thing's colossal! It's gonna kill us all!
	Amy	It's so huge! How big does one o' those things get?!
	Fry	Well, that depends on what one o' those things is. That seems like a fact worth knowing.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good, startling news, everyone!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I found a description of the creature in this medieval monster manual. Just as I feared. Attack type J.
	Amy	No! [extendedly] No!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[extendedly] Yes! [back to normal] It kills its prey by sucking out the skeleton, leaving nothing but a puddle of flesh.
	Amy	Ew!
	Leela	Ugh!
	Bender	Ew!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hence the Latin name bonus vampirus. Or, as you non-Catholics would say, the bone vampire!
	Zoidberg	Dios mío.
	Fry	That's ridiculous. Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones. I raised 'im on a simple diet o' Brussels sprouts an' mixed soda.
	Hermes	At least there's only one of 'em. The good news is they can't start breedin'.
	Prof. Farnsworth	The bad news, everyone, is the beast reproduces asexually. A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone-vampire porn, could produce dozens of deadly offspring.
	Zoidberg	That lucky bastard. I say kill it!
	Fry	But it loves me! And I love it.
	Zoidberg	Kill 'em both!
	Leela	Killing them seems like a hassle. Can't we just set it free to live with its own kind?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Poor, ignorant Leela. The bone vampire is now extinct on its home planet.
	Leela	That's perfect! We can reintroduce it to the wild and repopulate the species!
	Fry	Yeah! Let's do those Leela things.
	Fry	Well, buddy, how d'ya like your new home? See? He's happy already.
	Hermes	That thing doesn't have emotions, Fry. Its brain is the size of a walnut.
	Fry	So are walnuts and they're delicious. I'll miss you, Mr. Peppy. But you'll be happier here. So... Go on. Go. Goodbye, Mr. Peppy. Come on, man. Don't do this. Go on now. I mean it. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. It's time to let go! Ow! Thanks, Leela. He just needed a little extra push.
	Leela	Come on, Fry. Let's go home an'—
	Bender	Hold up! There alcohol around here somewhere. My Tanqueray-dar is goin' crazy. Aha-ha! Thought you could get away from me, huh? You lose again, you stupid intoxicant!
	Zoidberg	We're not from around here. Hello!
	Man #1	[says something in Gaelic]
	Hermes	Excuse me, but we're guests on your planet. Speak English!
	Man #2	Behave yourselves, gents. Off-worlders best be welcome here. Especially if we're trying to get the Olympics. May I buy you a drink? We don't get a lot of pretty faces around here.
	Leela	Uh... Sure. But I'm driving. I'll just have the smallest whisky you've got.
	Man #2	A small aquarium o' whisky for the busty lass!
	Leela	Thanks. I suppose I should know your name if I'm gonna be drinking ten gallons of alcohol with you.
	Man #2	McZongo. Angus McZongo. Major Angus McZongo. Handsome Major Angus McZongo. Esquire.
	Leela	Ooh! Handsome and esquire. I'm Turanga Leela. My crew an' I are from Earth.
	Angus McZongo	So what brings you folks here to Doohan 6?
	Amy	We just released an endangered animal back into the wild. A bone vampire!
	Hermes	No need to thank us. Your shocked stares of gratitude say it all.
	Angus McZongo	Dear God. You brought back the bone vampire?! The damn things wreaked bloody havoc on our livestock for centuries!
	Woman	Aye! Until McZongo 'ere shot 'em all into extinction, 'e did.
	Man #3	Now we've got more livestock than we can slaughter. Oh, aye. 'Tis a Bonnie time to be an ignorant villager.
	Man #4	We kinna have no murderin' bone vampires back 'ere!
	Man #3	Kill it afore it puts a bun in its own oven and repopulates the bleedin' planet!
	Fry	No!
	Angus McZongo	Angus is right.
	Hermes	I thought you were named Angus.
	Man #1	We're all named Angus!
	Fry	Please! Mr. Peppy won't attack your livestock. He's a vegetarian and 'e's not even preachy about it!
	Angus McZongo	Poppycock. Once he gets the smell o' bones, there'll be no stoppin' 'im. Tonight, Mr. Peppy must die.
	Leela	Angus, wait. My strictly platonic friend is right. At least wait a few days before you decide to kill it.
	Angus McZongo	The last time I hesitated, a bone vampire snicked out me left shin.
	Leela	Please! Just a few days.
	Angus McZongo	Well, 'twould give us a chance to get to know each other. The beast lives! For now.
	Leela	Thank you, Angus.
	Men	[in unison] You're welcome!
	Fry	I don't trust that McZongo. Maybe I should go keep an eye on Mr. Peppy.
	Leela	Don't worry about McZongo. He an' I are having brunch tomorrow. I'm thinking of wearing this.
	Fry	It's nice! But there's still somethin' I don't like about that guy. My dad always said you could tell a lot about a man by the rigidity of 'is shins.
	Zoidberg	What is?!
	UNKNOWN	UNKNOWN, Gryffindor, Slytherin an' Hufflepuff! It killed Little Angus!
	Prof. Farnsworth	They're all dead! And their bones are gone! This was no accident.
	Angus McZongo	Still think your Mr. Peppy is harmless, Fry?
	Fry	He wouldn't do this in our sleep. He would not, could not to a sheep.
	Angus McZongo	The deal is off! The beast must die!
	Bender	Ooh! Pimpy!
	Fry	What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for Mr. Peppy to be killed?
	Bender	Sounds like a plan! Guess I'll pass the time by lightin' up an El Jerko!
	Leela	Okay! That's it! I need some air.
	Leela	Who's there? Hermes, is this one o' your zany practical jokes?
	Fry	Leela, are you okay? Did you drink too many aquaria?
	Hermes	Look! The bone vampire!
	Leela	Mr. Peppy attacked me. Quick! Count my bones. There should be two-hundred-and-five!
	Leela	Okay. That's better. Keep 'em comin'!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm sorry, Fry, but no vegetarian could've done this.
	Fry	I know. An', as much as I love Mr. Peppy, I love Leela more. He has to be... Put down.
	Amy	Aw, don't feel bad. Major McZongo's an experienced hunter. He'll blow Mr. Peppy's head off as painlessly as possible.
	Fry	No! Not McZongo! If anyone's gonna kill Mr. Peppy, it should be me.
	Zoidberg	Fry, I know you're upset right now, but I hope you'll consider donating the body to science dinner.
	Fry	Here, Mr. Peppy. Mmm. Lovely bones.
	Hermes	We've been walkin' for hours. I hope we can find our way back.
	Amy	Don't worry. I left a trail of bread crumbs.
	Bender	An' I left a trail of cigars!
	Leela	You don't have to do this, Fry. Mr. Peppy just gave me a little love concussion.
	Fry	Thanks, Leela, but I have no choice. I can't let my monstruous deboner get anywhere near you.
	Hermes	There it is!
	Fry	Well, this is it. You guys wait here. This is gonna kill him more than it does me. Goodbye, boy. I'll think of you whenever I sit on something round.
	Amy	What's happening?! Did you kill it?!
	Mr. Peppy	The bloody idiot bloody-shot me! I'm all bloody-bloody!
	Bender	Wha?!
	Fry	Mr. Peppy?! Bullets make you talk?!
	Bender	That's not Mr. Peppy!
	Amy	Jinkies! He Scooby-Doo-ed us!
	Leela	Why, Major McZongo? Why?
	Angus McZongo	Oh, it's been thirty years since last I killed a bone vampire. The villagers dinna idolise me like they used to.
	Amy	You seem pretty popular at the pub.
	Angus McZongo	I work there as a greeter! Your beast was my chance to be a hero again. But the damn thing was a vegetarian! So I slaughtered the sheep meself.
	Leela	But why did you attack me?
	Angus McZongo	So I could impress you by seeking revenge on the creature. Us greeters don't get a lot of action. On paper, it seemed like a win-win situation.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Do you realise what this means, Fry?! Your pet's not dangerous after all!
	Fry	I told ya! Mr. Peppy's a lover, not a fighter. Like Dwayne "The Rock" "The Tooth Fairy" Johnson.
	UNKNOWN	UNKNOWN! Hey. What's that bone-sucking sound?
	Fry	It's Mr. Peppy! I'd know 'im anywhere.
	Leela	Huh. So, apparently, Major McZongo and Mr. Peppy were each doing about half the sheep killing.
	Fry	Why, Mr. Peppy? Why? Ooh. That tickles. Now I really do have to kill you.
	Man #3	Wait! Don't shoot. The beast is a godsend. Like I said, we've more livestock than we can slaughter. But, thanks to this ravenous bogle, that's nae more a problem.
	Man #5	Angus is right. The cursed thing even debones 'em. Which is perfect for today's fast-paced, lazy consumer.
	Man #1	Dersu Uzala, Yojimbo, Rashomon! The beast must live!
	Leela	You know what the best part is? From now on, whenever we're eating fresh, organic space meat, we'll know exactly where it comes from.
	Fry	One bucket o' double-friend, triple-salted, boneless sheep tots, please.
	Teenaged Alien	What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?
	Fry	All kinds.
	Leela	Eh... Make it two.
	Leela	[over credits] An' a small whisky. Large.
