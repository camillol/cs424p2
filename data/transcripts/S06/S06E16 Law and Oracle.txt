	Fry	[voice-over] After centuries as a delivery boy, nothin' surprises me.
	Zoidberg	You stink, loser.
	Leela	[off camera] Hey, Fry! [Leela enters.] Pizza goin' out. Come on!
	Fry	Alright. I'll take the red rocket.
	Fry	Hello? Pizza delivery for... [Fry takes a piece of paper from his pocket.] D. Frosted Wang? [Fry grunts.] Not another crank delivery! Why don't I read these things ahead of time?! [Ipji, Terry, and Lou step out of the cryo-tube shadows and burst out laughing.] One time was funny. But, every week for ten years, not as funny.
	Ipji	True. Not as funny. But still somewhat funny.
	Fry	And... And then they burst out laughing a second time. [All but Fry laugh. Fry sighs.] I've been a delivery boy for a thousand years. Isn't there any room for promotion around here?
	Hermes	There'll be no promotions unless somebody dies. And, even then, only if we can bring 'em back as a zombie like Scruffy.
	Scruffy	Life and death are a seamless continuum.
	Fry	Well, could I at least get some encouragement? I could use a shot in the arm. [Shots are fired from outside the building, piercing the window that is the closest to the crew. Fry falls down and screams.] I got shot in the leg!
	Bender	Roberto! [Roberto approaches the table.] What are you doin' here?
	Roberto	What? A fella can't drop in on ol' friends and hold 'em hostage?
	Zoidberg	[calm] I'm good! And you?
	Smitty	[off camera, on a speaker] Attention, criminal Robot in the boding.
	Smitty	[off-camera, on a speaker] Come out with your hands up.
	Bender	Never!
	Smitty	[off-camera, on a speaker] Uh, other guy.
	Roberto	Listen up, piggies! I want a hovercopter. And a non-marked sandwich. And a new face with, like, a... A Hugh Grant look.
	Roberto	[off-camera] And, every five minutes I don't get it, someone's gonna get stabbed in the ass!
	Zoidberg	[off-camera] He's bluffing. [A stabbing sound is heard.] Ouch!
	Zoidberg	He's not bluffing!
	URL	You call for a chopper?
	Roberto	Nah. I specifically said hovercopter.
	URL	One chopper comin' up.
	Smitty	You know, URL. [URL has entered the hovercar.] Sometimes it's almost too much for me.
	URL	You mean the respect we get and the high level of job satisfaction?
	Smitty	There's that, but I'm also talkin' about the non-stop promotions and the free hot ride.
	Leela	I do love a man in uniform. [Fry clears his throat, laying emphasis on his delivery-boy uniform.] I mean a uniform that doesn't involve short pants.
	Fry	I can see I have no future here. My only option is to resign with dignity. [Fry takes his shorts off and gives them to Hermes.] Here are my shorts.
	Fry	Hello. I'd like to enrol in Police Academy.
	Policeman #1	You think you can just waltz in here with no pants and become a cop?
	Fry	That's the plan.
	Policeman #1	I like you, kid. I got no pants on either.
	Fry	I can see that. You're quite a bit taller than me.
	Policeman #1	Welcome to Police Academy.
	Fry	Hi! I'm Fry.
	Brown Robot	I'm the Sound Effects 5000.
	Fry	Wow! That would be impressive if you were a Human!
	Sound Effects 5000	[sad] Yeah...
	Policeman #2	On your feet for Chief O'Mannahan.
	Chief O'Mannahan	At ease, cadets. I'll make this short and sweet 'cause I'm PMS-in' like a lumberjack. Police Academy is not for everybody. You're gonna get your boobs scuffed. But, if you got the vulva to stick it out, I'll be proud to call you ladies policemen.
	Fry	Sir! Yes, ma'am!
	Black-haired man	Yeah. That's great. [The black-haired man approaches the driver's window.] Now can you actually turn on the ignition?
	Sound Effects 5000	[sad] I don't have any hands.
	Chief O'Mannahan	Well, it's that time of the month. Graduation Day. So grow up hair and put 'em together for our new officers.
	Amy	[off camera] Woohoo!
	Bender	Hooray for the pigs!
	Chief O'Mannahan	Graduates, you are hereby officially cops. Now movin' along. Nothin' to see here.
	Zoidberg	Hooray! Free sky sticks! [A lightsaber falls on Zoidberg's head, ridding him of his crust.] Ooh. [Zoidberg points his finger accusingly.] Police brutality!
	Chief O'Mannahan	[to herself] Nice... [The camera zooms out, revealing two tables where eight policemen, including URL and Fry, are sitting.] [to the policemen] Alright. Before we head out, I'll be teaming up our new officers with their ironically matched partners. Sound Effects 5000, you'll be with Gretsky.
	Gretsky	Ow, my tinnitus!
	Chief O'Mannahan	Fry, due to the unfortunate loss of Officer Smith, you'll be riding with URL.
	URL	And Smitty was just a few days from retirement.
	Fry	Wuh— What happened?
	URL	He took a early retirement. Damn.
	Professor Farnsworth	Let's get down to business.
	Amy	Aren't you gonna say [imitating Professor Farnsworth's voice] Good news, everyone?
	Professor Farnsworth	No, I just said that for Fry's benefit. May the poor fellow feel better about his pointless job.
	Hermes	As much as I miss 'im, he didn't really serve much purpose around here. [Leela and Amy open their eyes.] Though he did walk Zoidberg.
	Professor Farnsworth	In any case, I've improved on Fry by sticking some wheels on a board so Leela and Bender can easily make the next delivery without him.
	Bender	Neat. So where are we goin'?
	Professor Farnsworth	Pandora.
	Leela	That dangerous, 3-D planet? Can't we just send our avatars?
	Professor Farnsworth	No! It's cheaper just to have you die.
	Fry	Whoa! Fifteen miles over the speed of light.
	URL	That's a violation of the law of Lorentz invariance, baby.
	Fry	Light 'em up.
	URL	Look out for that particular individual.
	Dandy Jim	An electric wall, eh? I can't see the harm in peein' on that.
	URL	Whoa! Where my man learn that?
	Fry	SunnyD commercial.
	URL	Let's refract this sucker.
	Fry	DNA and career chip, please.
	URL	Erwin Schrödinger, huh? What's in the box, Schrödinger?
	Erwin Schrödinger	Um... A cat, some poison, und a caesium atom.
	Fry	The cat! Is it alive or dead? [Schrödinger is not given the time to reply.] Alive or dead?!
	URL	Answer him, fool.
	Erwin Schrödinger	It's a superposition of both states until you open it and collapse the wave function.
	Fry	Says you.
	URL	There's also a lotta drugs in there.
	Leela	So... You're a Robot?
	Chief O'Mannahan	You boys did good. Nailed a major violator of the laws of Physics.
	URL	He's goin' down. [URL lifts up Schrödinger's cat.] Cat's gonna testify.
	Chief O'Mannahan	Guys like this really bust my uterus. You're both getting a promotion! Ever heard of the Future Crimes Division?
	Fry	Tomorrow I have.
	Leela	[off camera] Oops.
	Leela	I can't make out a thing!
	Bender	Well, I guess you should've had two eyes!
	Leela	Just deliver the package and let's get outta here.
	Bender	Screw that! [Bender kicks the board back to Leela.] I ain't no delivery boy! I'm the company's chef.
	Leela	Oh! You're the chef, are you? [Leela stands up.] Then why don't you make us something nice to eat?
	Bender	[muttering] I'll make you something— [Bender leaves the room and the door closes. It is opened as Bender re-enters.] [angry] Here's your damn peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
	Blond man	Now that we can predict crimes with 99% accuracy, we can arrest most perpetrators before they even perpetrate anything.
	Fry	That's ridiculous. Only horoscopes can predict the future.
	Blond man	That's what we used to think. Until we invented... [The blond man opens the door, revealing it to lead to no elevator, but to another room, in the middle of which there is a Robot lying on a tub with his eyes closed.] This.
	Fry	Whoa!
	URL	Slowed on, baby.
	Blond man	The cybernetic oracle. The ultimate man-machine hybrid. Programmed with every crime ever recorded and implanted with the brain cells of History's greatest detectives. We call 'im... Pickles.
	Fry	On account of it's like he's floating in a jar?
	Blond man	Exactly. The oracle's visions are recorded on these coloured balls. [The blond man lifts up a box containing four balls: One green, one black, one red, and one white with pink stains.] Green is larceny. Black is fraud. Red, homicide.
	Fry	What's pink pocodots?
	Blond man	Clown slaughter. It happens more often than you think. [An alarm goes off and a red light flashes. Pickles' brain begins sparking. A red ball surfaces in the tub.] Clutter in the ball! [The blond man reaches the ball with a fishing net.] Red ball, homicide!
	Fry	[extendedly] Woo!
	Blond man	Suspect: Male, six-foot-one, distinctive mustard stain on his forehead.
	Hattie	[on the video] My kajigger!
	Blond man	Victim: Hattie McDoogal.
	Fry	Look! The clock says 5:08. [Fry looks at his wrist.] It's 4:30 right now!
	URL	Uh-oh. We only have a half hour to chill out before we head over.
	Old man	Oh, Hattie. When I look into your one good eye, I see a reflection of beauty.
	Hattie	Oh, fresh.
	URL	Freeze, fool.
	Fry	You're under arrest for future murder!
	Old man	Ja? [The old man jumps to behind the couch.] You can't arrest me for future murder after it's right-now murder!
	Hattie	My kajigger! [The old man accidentally opens the cage with the snow globe, causing the birds to start flying around him. He drops the snow globe, screams, and is handcuffed by Fry and URL.] So he didn't really wanna marry me?
	URL	Nah. See, he knew you'd left everything to your parakeets in your will.
	Fry	He was gonna murder you, marry your parakeets, and then poison them with an arsenic-laced cuttlebone.
	URL	Classic move. Aw, yeah.
	Chief O'Mannahan	Congratulations on your big bust.
	Fry	You too.
	Chief O'Mannahan	Keep it up and you boys might just make detective. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go drop a big one.
	Fry	Wow! I can't believe it. One more promotion and I'll be a real detective. Like Sherlock Holmes or Speed Buggy.
	Chief O'Mannahan	Eight pounds. I'm namin' 'er Bert!
	URL	Mazel tov, Chief. That's a beautiful bathroom baby.
	URL	Ain't you headin' home, Phil?
	Fry	In a minute. I just wanna finish this paperless work.
	URL	Don't stay up too late. We gotta lotta people to shoot tomorrow.
	Fry	Hello? Anyone? [Fry grunts.] There's never a cop around when you need one.
	Female voice	Green ball, larceny.
	Fry	The thief seems to be some sorta ghost. Or is he? [Fry zooms in, revealing the thief to be Bender. Fry gasps.] Bender?!
	Hermes	[off camera] Item seven. [The camera zooms out, revealing that Zoidberg, Professor Farnsworth, Amy, and Hermes are sitting at the conference table. Hermes is looking at a set of paper sheets.] Our corporate tax rate remained unchanged this fiscal year.
	Amy	That's not funny.
	Hermes	It's not supposed to be funny. It's a business meetin'.
	Zoidberg	Things used to be funny around here! Noses were picked. Pants fell down. So what changed? Only Fry could say... And he's gone!
	Amy	Hey! Bender and Leela are back from Pandora. How was it?
	Leela	Awful. We had nothing to say to each other. [Leela sits down.] So we had to listen to Bender's Eagles album for twenty-seven hours.
	Bender	Beats talkin' to you, "Witchy Woman". [Fry enters, dressed in his NNYPD uniform, looking serious. The crew cheers.] Hey, meatbag!
	Hermes	Look at you!
	Leela	Hubba-hubba. Your pants go almost all the way to your ankles!
	Fry	Good afternoon, individuals. [to Bender] Sir, would you mind stepping outta the building?
	Bender	Normally, when a cop asks me that, I spray whipped cream in his eyes and run away. But, to ditch these losers, gladly.
	Fry	Bender, be honest with me. Are you planning a big heist?
	Bender	Usually, but not at the moment.
	Fry	I only ask 'cause the oracle thinks you're gonna pull of a major theft next Thursday.
	Bender	Next Thursday, you say? Pray, continue.
	Fry	Are you familiar with this particular location?
	Bender	I may have a burgling familiarity with it.
	Fry	Does the word Maltese mean anything to you?
	Bender	The Maltese Liquor?! The strongest and most valuable malt liquor ever brewed! And soon it will be mine... [Bender laughs evilly.] I'm sorry. You were sayin'?
	Fry	Bender, I'm only tellin' you this so you can avoid committing the crime.
	Bender	[while writing on the pad] "Avoid committing the crime". Got it.
	Fry	You wrote "Commit the crime"!
	Fry	There's gotta be some way to stop Bender. [Fry strokes his chin.] Maybe something in the oracle's prediction that I missed before due to incompetence. [Fry continues moving the photographs around. He stops at the one showing the gun.] Wait. Who's the trigger-happy jerk? [Fry rewinds and zooms out, revealing the shooter to be himself. He gasps.] That's me. I recognise the face.
	Bender	[on the video] You shot me. You miserable dingus!
	Fry	No! No! What have I will have done?
	URL	Man, that's heavy. [Fry is alarmed. The camera zooms out, revealing that URL is standing behind Fry.] Osmium heavy.
	Fry	Are you gonna turn me in for concealing evidence?
	URL	Say what? You're my partner, home-Fry. [URL puts his hand on Fry's shoulder.] Besides, I got my own secrets.
	Chief O'Mannahan	Anything big worth checkin' out?
	URL	Just your big, jangly booty, baby.
	Chief O'Mannahan	See ya tonight, toots.
	Fry	[confused] You... And— And the Chief?!
	URL	We been gettin' it on. Right there in your chair. [URL points to the chair where Fry is sitting. Fry looks disgusted.] I'm like, "Oh, baby! Oh, baby!" And she's like, [in a deeper voice] "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
	Fry	I would never shoot Bender! Never! He taught me how to shave.
	URL	Revision ball. By decidin' not to shoot Bender, you created an alternate future.
	Fry	[on the video] I could never shoot you! Never! You taught me how to shave.
	Fry	See?
	Fry	[on the video] Just get outta here. [Fry puts the gun down and closes his eyes.] Go!
	URL	Now dig the unintended consequences.
	Bender	[on the video] My friends, let us share this booze in a toast to our dear friend, Bender. [Everyone drinks. All but Bender start suffocating and fall down, dead. The coffins of Amy, Hermes, Professor Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Leela close by themselves. Fry walks up to Leela's coffin and puts a flower on it. Bender is also there.] Oops.
	URL	[on the video] The Maltese Liquor done destroyed their brains. Fools should've known it's fatal for anyone but Robots and Billy Dee Williams.
	Fry	So, if I don't shoot Bender, all my other friends will die?!
	URL	Fate is a freaky mistress. Much like the Chief. Look out!
	Fry	Somethin' is not right. I refuse to believe it. Rewind!
	Hedonism Bot	Ooh. Are you the calloused working man I ordered?
	Bender	Uh... [Bender looks the other way.] Sure.
	Bender	In order to fix your leaky roof, I'll need to spend two or three hours down here in the wine cellar.
	Hedonism Bot	I'll be upstairs putting batteries and things.
	Bender	Whoa! [Bender zooms in on a table sustaining the bottle of Maltese Liquor with his eyes.] The Maltese Liquor! [Bender zooms out and takes off his moustache and belt.] Forty ounces of Heaven! [The dog shown by one of the photographs appears and barks angrily. Bender grabs a slice of steak from his chest cabinet.] Here, boy. [The dog stops barking.] This is for you. [Bender knocks the dog unconscious with the slice of steak and eats it as he walks towards the table.] Ah! [Bender arrives at the table, hums, grabs a dynamite cylinder from his chest cabinet, lights the dynamite cylinder with his finger, grabs a cigar from his chest cabinet, puts the cigar in his mouth, lights the cigar with the dynamite cylinder, closes his chest door, and exhales smoke towards the bottle on the table, revealing the safe shown by one of the photographs.] Invisible safe, eh? [Bender giggles, is alarmed by the imminent explosion of the dynamite cylinder, screams, dropping the cigar, and places the dynamite cylinder on the safe. The dynamite cylinder explodes, causing the safe's door to open. Bender uncovers his ears and rubs his hands.] Aw, yeah, baby. [Bender grabs the bottle.] Two-hundred-and-ten proof.
	Fry	That's all the proof I need. [The camera zooms out, revealing that Fry is pointing a gun at Bender.] Put the bottle back!
	Bender	We both know I won't do that! Either you're gonna shoot me or I'm gonna spray whipped cream in your eyes and walk outta here like a big shot.
	Fry	Bender, no! You don't have to do something just 'cause it's gonna happen! The future's making a chump outta you!
	Bender	Oh, yeah?! [Bender puts the bottle on the table.] Well, I'm gonna make a chump outta the future! I'm not stealin' anything.
	Fry	Yes! I stopped the crime without shooting you. The oracle was wrong!
	Male voice	[off camera] Was I?
	Fry	Pickles?!
	Pickles	Yes. It is I, Pickles! I set the whole thing up. Everyone will think Bender's the thief, while I make off with that glorious brew.
	Bender	[confused] Seriously? Why?
	Pickles	So I can kill my Human brain cells. Do you have any idea what a burden it is to know everything that will ever happen?! To never be surprised. To know the punch line of every joke hours in advance.
	Fry	Like watching Leno.
	Pickles	And that is why I faked the prediction of this crime. Nevertheless, stay with me here. [Pickles begins walking.] Things will now happen just as I fake-predicted. [Pickles points the gun at Bender.] Bender, you're going to hand me that bottle. [Bender reaches for the bottle on the table.] Not that one! The real one. Which you switched when Fry stupidly looked away.
	Fry	Hey!
	Bender	Aw, man. Why do you gotta be so oracle-y?
	Pickles	Fry... You are going to shoot Bender, killing him and shattering the fake bottle. Just as I predicted. [Pickles points the gun at Fry.] Do it! It is your destiny!
	Fry	Funny thing about destiny. [Fry points his gun at Pickles.] Sometimes fate has other plans. [Fry shoots in Pickles' direction, hitting the invisible safe, which redirects the shot to Bender. Bender screams, drops the bottle, and falls down.] Oh, nuts.
	Bender	You shot me! You miserable dingus!
	Pickles	And now the part I didn't show you. [Pickles shoots Fry. Fry screams and falls down.] Everyone will think Bender killed you. [Pickles places his gun in Bender's hand.] And I walk away with a goofy juice. [Pickles walks towards a mirror, laughs evilly, opens the real bottle, and drinks the malt liquor. Pickles' brain begins sparking and Pickles makes sounds of both pain and pleasure. His brain is now significantly smaller.] Finally... Blissful ignorance! I have no idea what's going to happen next!
	Fry	[off camera] Did you get that, Chief?
	Chief O'Mannahan	We got it all from behind this prediction-proof glass.
	Pickles	But... How could you know my prediction was fake?
	Fry	I knew somethin' was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then it hit me. [Fry presses the NNYPD badge on his helmet and a hologram of Bender sharing the malt liquor in the Planet Express conference room is projected from his nose.] You showed Bender sharing the deadly booze with our friends. [Fry presses the NNYPD badge and the hologram disappears.] Bender would never share!
	Bender	The very idea!
	Fry	So we set up this little charade based on an episode of Speed Buggy.
	URL	With the added benefit of me and the Chief bein' locked in a small room.
	Hedonism Bot	Shall we adjourn to the dungeon?
	Fry	Well, I got my shield for stopping Bender. [Fry lifts up his NNYPD badge. Zoidberg, Amy, Professor Farnsworth, Leela, Hermes, and Bender are sitting at the conference table. They all cheer.] But then I got fired for tipping off Bender.
	Professor Farnsworth	Fry, we have no idea what you do around here, but we desperately need you back.
	Fry	Ruh— Really? Um, I don't suppose there's any chance I can get a promotion...
	Professor Farnsworth	Sure! What the heck! I hereby promote you to... [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] Executive delivery boy!
	Fry	Executive?!
	Hermes	[whispering to Leela] It's a meanin'less title, but it helps insecure people feel better about themselves.
	Fry	I feel better about myself!
