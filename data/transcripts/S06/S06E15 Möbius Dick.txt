	Leela	Where's the Professor?
	Bender	Eh, probably dead. Already dissolving in a bathtub if we're lucky.
	Professor Farnsworth	I was out on the widow's walk keeping a hopeless vigil for the return of my first delivery crew. [Professor Farnsworth walks up to the table.] It's been fifty years since they disappeared.
	Fry	Huh. I knew you had other crews, but you never told us you had a first crew.
	Professor Farnsworth	I remember it like it was interesting.
	Professor Farnsworth	[voice-over] I had just built my new shipping and receiving emporium.
	Professor Farnsworth	[voice-over] And I scoured the hardware-store parking lot to assemble the finest crew imaginable.
	Professor Farnsworth	[voice-over] There was Candy, the raunchy by-the-books navigator... [The camera pans over to a Robot from the parking lot.] Lifter, the devastatingly handsome forklift... [The camera pans over to a man from the parking lot. The man blinks three times.] And Captain Lando Tucker, a dedicated young man with no characteristics.
	Lando Tucker	We'll deliver that package or die trying.
	Zoidberg	Eh! It's all my favourite patients. And also Captain Tucker. Pow!
	Candy	Whoa!
	Lando Tucker	You totally got me, Dr. John. [Lando Tucker crosses his arms.] You're hilarious.
	Hermes	Zoidberg was popular?!
	Amy	Zoidberg had hair?!
	Professor Farnsworth	I never said he had hair! [Professor Farnsworth stands up and puts both his hands on the table.] If you chose to imagine 'im that way, that's your business. [Professor Farnsworth sits down.] Anyway...
	Professor Farnsworth	[voice-over] The time came for our first delivery.
	Young woman	Lando, don't forget about me and Junior.
	Lando Tucker	I won't, honey. [Lando Tucker puts his right hand on his chest.] Or die trying.
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, crew, this is it. That cookie bouquet isn't going to deliver itself.
	Professor Farnsworth	[off camera] Ten...
	Professor Farnsworth	[continued] Nine and so on. Three... [A scientist turns two dials from OFF to ON.] Two... [A scientist opens a glass case containing a button.] One.
	Scientist	Go, you big metal bird! Get up there!
	Hermes	Incredible! [Hermes turns to his right.] Zoidberg had friends?!
	Zoidberg	It was a different time.
	Professor Farnsworth	[voice-over] Everything was going smoothly until right after that part I was just telling you about. [Professor Farnsworth continues walking among the scientists. Another scientist turns to him and lifts up a telephone.] Suddenly, Amanda's aunt called to say her niece hadn't received her cookie bouquet.
	Professor Farnsworth	[voice-over] I watched the skies for weeks. With only occasional breaks to tender my grief diarrhea.
	Professor Farnsworth	[voice-over] Just when all hope was lost...
	Professor Farnsworth	The ship's escape pod! [Professor Farnsworth takes a step back just as an escape pod with PLANET EXPRESS and a Planet Express logo on it crashes into the wall. The escape pod opens. Zoidberg, who has unkempt, white hair, emerges, falls down, and stands up.] What happened up there, Johnny?
	Zoidberg	Aw! Don't make me remember! So horrible, it was.
	Amy	I thought you said he didn't have hair.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, but something he saw on that mission traumatised 'im so severely, he grew hair! [Professor Farnsworth hits the holographic projector on the conference table with both his hands.] Just so it could turn white! Sadly, my brave crew was gone forever.
	Leela	That poor, incompetent crew. [Leela puts her right hand on both Professor Farnsworth's hands.] What do you think happened, Professor?
	Professor Farnsworth	They were lost in the Bermuda Tetrahedron!
	Leela	That's ridiculous. [Leela turns to her right and crosses her arms.] The Bermuda Tetrahedron is just a myth.
	Professor Farnsworth	I'm glad you're so brave in the face of the unknown, Leela. [Professor Farnsworth deactivates the holographic projector and sits down.] Because, for your next mission, you'll be flying directly through... [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] The Bermuda Tetrahedron!
	Leela	Or we could fly around it.
	Professor Farnsworth	Of course you could! You'd be stupid not to.
	Bender	Supposing we're not stupid, what kinda stupid mission is this?!
	Professor Farnsworth	You'll be picking up a monument commemorating my lost crew. [Professor Farnsworth folds his hands.] To be unveiled Tuesday at their memorial ceremony. All the grieving families will be there. [Professor Farnsworth unfolds his hands.] Plus, a popsicle cart!
	Leela	You can count on us, Professor. We'll get that monument here in time.
	Bender	Hooray!
	Amy	Woohoo!
	Bender	Yeah!
	Leela	Or die trying.
	Zoidberg	We're gonna try— What?
	Green Alien	'Ere you go. "In memory of the 1st Planet Express ship and it's crew".
	Leela	Hang on. [Leela points at the statue with her left hand.] It's shouldn't have an apostrophe. This means and it is crew. What the hell's wrong with you?!
	Green Alien	It's a minor error, lady. I mean, we're space Aliens. [The green Alien points at himself with his four hands.] It's a miracle we can even speak English.
	Leela	The miracle is that I'm not kickin' your ass! [Leela hits the green Alien's chest with her right index finger.] I insist you recarve the entire statue correctly.
	Green Alien	Okay. Okay. [screaming] Hey, Charlie! Hack off another block of ivory!
	Amy	[off camera] Well, the statue's perfect now.
	Amy	Too bad we won't make it back in time for the memorial service.
	Fry	Whoa!
	Leela	We're cutting through the Bermuda Tetrahedron.
	Bender	Woo! [Bender turns to Leela.] Wait. The Bermuda Tetrahedron?
	Zoidberg	Aw... I think I'm remembering that thing I forgot.
	Amy	Uh-oh. The dials are terrified!
	Leela	Brace yourselves. It's Tickle Me Elmo's fire!
	Bender	Ow.
	Leela	There. See? It was no big thing.
	Hermes	What was that big thing?
	Fry	[off camera] It's a spaceship graveyard. [on camera] Why did we have to come 'ere at night?
	Hermes	Look at all these famous lost ships. [Hermes gasps and points to his right with his left hand.] There's the Garmin. [Hermes gasps and points to his left with his left hand.] And the TomTom.
	Leela	Over there! It's the original Planet Express ship!
	Amy	[off camera] What caused all that damage?
	Amy	Could it've been flavour-blasted?
	Leela	We'd better investigate. [There is thunder.] Looks like an Ion Storm, though. [Leela turns to her right.] Everyone suit up!
	Leela	Whatever happened here, that first crew left in a hurry. [The camera zooms out, revealing a table with three hamburgers, three soda cups, and two chip packages on it.] The table is still set from McDonald's value dinner!
	Zoidberg	I remember. I remember! [Zoidberg walks up to the table.] This is what traumatised me. Such a meal to got to waste! [Zoidberg takes his helmet off, throws it away, and eats the food.] And, with that... [Zoidberg burps.] I have closure.
	Amy	Hey, Zoidberg. You're cockatieling.
	Zoidberg	Oh, no. [Zoidberg blinks.] Something's happening! [Zoidberg looks around.] What's happening?!
	Zoidberg	Oh, right! And there was a giant killer space whale.
	Bender	Holy crap! [Bender points at the space whale.] It's a giant space fish!
	Leela	Actually, the space whale isn't a space fish. [The space whale opens its mouth.] It's a space mammal.
	Bender	Wow, interesting. I'm both impressed and being eaten.
	Hermes	Spacewalk, people! Spacewalk for your lives!
	Fry	Man, look at 'im go! Like a millionaire on a cocktail wiener.
	Zoidberg	[repeatedly] Woob.
	Leela	I did it! I outran 'im!
	Zoidberg	Relax, friends.
	Zoidberg	Panic, jerks!
	Hermes	That's no ordinary space whale! [Hermes turns to his right.] It's a four-dimensional space whale!
	Amy	Of course! And it only breaches into our 3-D universe to hunt and fill its lungs with vacuum!
	Leela	Whatever its beef is, our one mission now is to get that monument to Earth.
	Leela	Correction: Our one mission now is to avenge the loss of that monument.
	Amy	Shmeesh! He gonked off the engines!
	Leela	That won't stop me! [The lights go back on. Leela stands up.] Raise the solar sails. I'm goin' after that "Möbius Dick".
	Hermes	You been hittin' the Red Stripe, woman!
	Leela	Comport yourself, Mr. Conrad! When we're at space, the Captain's word is law. [Leela points at herself with her left hand.] I could marry you and Bender against your will if I wanted to.
	Hermes	You wouldn't dare!
	Bender	I've been married to worse.
	Fry	Leela, I'm no doctor, but I'm afraid you be exhibiting symptoms of illin'. [Fry removes his hand from Leela's shoulder. Amy, Zoidberg, and Hermes have stood up.] You're risking all our lives for your own personal obsession.
	Leela	There's nothing personal about this! [Leela points at Fry with her right hand.] That thing screwed up my delivery! This time, [musical sting] it's business!
	Leela	Maybe, if I move the compass like this, it will somehow kill the whale.
	Amy	Leela, we need to talk. You've gone from crazy like a fox to crazy like Fox News!
	Leela	Fear not the space behemoth. [Leela turns back to her right.] In my dreams, I've peered beyond its eyes and into the cackling hell within us all.
	Fry	Okay... [Fry looks down.] That's a good point.
	Bender	Fry's right! Let's kill the Captain and order some strippers! [Bender walks up to Hermes.] [in a different tone] Yeah, what he said. [Bender walks up to Fry and points at him with both his hands.] [in his regular tone] It's a mutiny led by Fry!
	Leela	That's enough insubordination, Mr. Fry!
	Bender	[in a different tone] String 'im up!
	Bender	Things look bad enough without having to look closer at them. [Bender sees the four-dimensional space whale and gasps loudly.] Look! Off in the distance! It's exhaling!
	Leela	[off camera] Use boaty talk!
	Bender	Thare she blows!
	Leela	Alright. [Fry, Zoidberg, Hermes, Bender, and Amy look at Leela.] Which of you space dogs has the guts and know-how to harpoon that whale?
	Amy	I spent a semester in Africa harpooning giraffes. And giraffes are basically just land space whales.
	Leela	Miss Wong, you have the 'poon.
	Amy	Oh, God! I'm having a Serengeti flashback! [furiously] Die, you dirty giraffe!
	Amy	Well, I got it. Now what, Captain?
	Leela	You know, I'm not sure. [Leela turns to her left. The four-dimensional space whale, which is seen through the window, continues flying.] I guess I thought whales died when you harpooned them.
	Leela	[off camera] Don't worry.
	Leela	I'll drop the anchor.
	Zoidberg	Ouch.
	Hermes	She's diving into the fourth dimension!
	Amy	We have to cut the rope!
	Leela	Negative, Sailor Moon. [Leela lets go of the anchor.] We're goin' for a sleigh ride.
	Hermes	I can see sideways in time.
	Amy	Gee, I see CGI. [Amy rotates to the right.] IGC ees I, eej.
	Fry	Poop! [Fry laughs.] Poop!
	Bender	Aw, yeah. [A highly duplicated Bender walks through the air.] [quickly, repeatedly] Bender! Bender! Bender!
	Bender	Aw. That was the greatest uncountably infinite bunch of guys I ever met.
	Amy	Look out! [Amy points forward.] It's pulling us through a field of spacebergs!
	Bender	Stupid rocks! [Amy looks at Bender.] Think they're so great!
	Amy	Well, they are giant diamonds.
	Bender	What?!
	Bender	Come to papa!
	Fry	A lotta Bender fell outta the crow's nest! [Fry points at the other camera with his left hand.] We need to cut the line!
	Leela	Enough of your mad obsession with Bender, Fry! We've got to murder that whale or die trying.
	Hermes	This has gone too far! [Hermes hits the table where he is working with both his hands and turns to his right.] Bender's one of Planet Express' most expensive appliances! And he's in trouble!
	Leela	That's it! [Leela stands up.] I warned you. Fry, Zoidberg, I now pronounce you man and—
	Zoidberg	Aw! So close.
	Leela	Unsit me, Mr. Conrad. We can't let the whale win! Hi-yah! [Leela kicks Hermes away. Hermes grunts. Leela pulls a knife out of her right boot with her right hand. Amy, Fry, and Bender turn to Leela.] [off camera] You're all too weak! [on camera] I can see that now. So I'll have to be my own crew! [Leela grabs the helmet on her chair, puts it on, and points at herself twice with her knife.] Understood? [in a different tone] You've gone mad, Captain. [in her regular tone] That's enough outta me! [Leela takes two steps forward.] Now come on! I gotta find that whale. [The four-dimensional space whale eats the part of the Planet Express ship where Hermes, Amy, Fry, and Bender are standing.] I found 'im! [Leela runs to what is now the edge of the Planet Express ship, jumps towards the four-dimensional space whale, passes her knife to her left hand, and screams.] With my Oxo Good Grips Cheese knife, I stab at thee. [Leela lands on the four-dimensional space whale and stabs it six times, grunting.] You do know I'm stabbing at thee, right?
	Zoidberg	Hello.
	Professor Farnsworth	Think, Zoidberg. [Professor Farnsworth rotates Zoidberg to the left.] You must remember something!
	Zoidberg	No! Nothing! For all I know, our friends could've been eaten by some kind of crazy space whale!
	Professor Farnsworth	Damn that Bermuda Tetrahedron! [Professor Farnsworth grabs a shaving machine with his left hand.] It's taken my latest crew just as it took my first one!
	Zoidberg	Not to mention those single socks from the dryer. Am I right?
	Professor Farnsworth	[angry] Shut up, Zoidberg! [Professor Farnsworth lets go of the shaving machine.] [sad] Oh, Zoidberg! [Professor Farnsworth puts both his hands around his head.] The grieving relatives will be gathered here tomorrow in need of comfort. [Professor Farnsworth removes his hands from his head as he walks, folds them, and turns to his left.] And, with no stone monument, they may well demand that I refund their admission fees.
	Leela	Where are we?
	Fry	Like that Bible guy who got swallowed by the whale! Pinocchio!
	Amy	This is all Obsessy Bessy's fault!
	Bender	Right on, sister. We should be back at Planet Express right now. Hiding from work in the ceiling. But no!
	Leela	For the last time, I'm not obsessed. I just want this whale to die, die, die!
	Hermes	Uh-oh. What's that loud digesting sound?
	Fry	[off camera] Holy crap! Four-dimensional bowels!
	Amy	Einstein was right.
	Leela	Why?! [Leela hits the wall with her right hand.] Why?! [Leela hits the wall with her right hand again.] Also, what and how?!
	Male voice	The great fish has chosen you for a higher purpose.
	Leela	It's a great mammal! [Leela points at the wall to her right.] See? It's got whiskers! And I saw it lactating earlier. [Leela looks to her left.] Wait. [Leela turns to her left.] Who said that?
	Deformed man	I was once Lando Tucker, captain of the first Planet Express ship.
	Leela	Ew! I'm Turanga Leela, captain of the current Planet Express ship. What's going on?
	Lando Tucker	It's very simple. Well, actually, it's very complicated. Luckily, I'm here to explain it. You see... This space whale feeds on... Obsession!
	Leela	Wow. Are you gross-looking. Go on.
	Lando Tucker	The great space serpent—
	Leela	[whispering] Mammal.
	Lando Tucker	[continued] Figured out long ago that no one's more obsessed than space captains.
	Leela	Oh! [Leela grunts.] What are these things?! [Leela fights off the tentacles.] Get away!
	Lando Tucker	The whale's nearly sucked me dry. It'll need a new source of obsession once I'm gone.
	Leela	How many times do I have to tell other people? I'm not obsessed!
	Lando Tucker	The whale is obsession, Leela! And you are the whale!
	Leela	[angry] I am not the whale! All I wanted was to complete my delivery. Is that too much to ask? One chicken-pickin' delivery? This whale's gonna pay! It can't escape what it already is. Me! I am the whale! [The camera zooms out, revealing that Leela's flesh has melded with that of the four-dimensional space whale.] [calm] See?
	Old lady	Fifty years, Junior! Fifty years of grippling sorrow!
	Paper-hatted salesman	Popsicles here. Can't mourn the dead without a popsicle.
	Leo	You think a popsicle gonna bring my daughter back?!
	Paper-hatted salesman	No, sir.
	Leo	You just talked yourself out of a sale.
	Inez	Poor Amy! My days of joy and luck are over! [Leo comforts Inez.] Guess I gotta quit that club.
	Turanga Morris	I can't believe our Leela's gone!
	Turanga Munda	You always think you're gonna disappear in space before your children.
	Professor Farnsworth	Welcome, everyone. [Zoidberg is eating a popsicle.] What a pleasure to see so many miserable faces.
	Zoidberg	Mmm! Lemony!
	Professor Farnsworth	I had intended to unveil a beautiful stone memorial today. But, due to the recent tragedy, I humbly ask you to join me in a simple prayer.
	Turanga Munda;Turanga Morris;Inez;Leo;Dwight;LaBarbara	[extendedly] Boo!
	Professor Farnsworth	No refunds! [Professor Farnsworth raises his right fist.] Shut up and bow your heads! [Munda, Morris, Inez, Leo, Dwight, LaBarbara, the old lady, and the old man close their eyes and bow their heads. Zoidberg does not. Professor Farnsworth raises his hands.] Oh, mighty Isis—
	Zoidberg	Oh, no! [Zoidberg stands up.] My deal is doing the thing!
	Professor Farnsworth	Good Lord! It's some kind of inter-dimensional space whale!
	Zoidberg	I just remembered. [Zoidberg's fin disappears.] That's the guy! [Zoidberg grows unkempt, brown hair.] Oy! Now with the horror hair.
	Paper-hatted salesman	Popsicles! Fill your gapin' mouth with a popsicle!
	Turanga Munda	[off camera] Leela! [on camera] You're alive! [Munda points at Leela with her left hand.] Is that how you and your friends are dressing now?!
	Leela	Hello, everyone. I suppose you're wonderin' why my flesh has melded with that of a giant space whale.
	Professor Farnsworth	I'll admit to a polite interest.
	Leela	At first, I was consumed by a dark obsession to kill the whale. Then I was consumed by the whale.
	Zoidberg	That sounds clever, but it doesn't explain much.
	Leela	Shut up, Zoidberg!
	Zoidberg	Okay.
	Leela	You see, beneath my obsession lay an even deeper obsession. An obsession so strong, it allowed me to overpower the beast's will and pilot it through space and time. An obsession... With completing my [echoing] delivery!
	Paper-hatted salesman	Get your—
	Old lady	[sad] Poor Lando... [happy] This is just how I want to remember him.
	Leela	Too bad! 'Cause he's still alive!
	Old lady	Lando?
	Lando Tucker	Told you I'd be back. [Lando Tucker puts his right hand on the old lady's left shoulder and the old man puts his right hand on her right arm.] [to the old man] You've grown, Junior.
	Old man	[indignant] I'm sixty-one.
	Inez	I dunno him! What else you got?!
	Professor Farnsworth	They haven't aged a day! [LaBarbara and Dwight walk away. Professor Farnsworth grabs Candy's right arm with both his hands. Leo and Inez walk away.] The whale must have some kind of Möbius colon that endlessly recycles time and space!
	Scruffy	Yup. That stands up to scrutiny.
	Leela	I should've listened to my crew. [Leela turns to the four-dimensional space whale.] That space whale wasn't a monster. [Leela turns to the others.] It was the obsession of me and others like me that made it into a monster.
	Lando Tucker	Mainly you.
	Leela	On the other hand, the stupid fish did eat us. You guys wanna do this?
	Amy	Yeah!
	Fry	You know it!
	Candy	So, Johnny, are we gonna pick up where we left off?
	Zoidberg	Eh!
