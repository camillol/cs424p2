	Hermes	Well, we're bankrupt in six, five...
	Hermes	Four, three...
	Hermes	Two, one. And we're out of business.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news! We're back in business. We've been hired to deliver an envelope.
	Leela	It's crunch time. Let's do this. [The Professors gives Amy, who is in a Robotic suit, the envolope, Amy gives it to Leela, and Leela sighs.] It's for you, Professor.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Great delivery, everyone. You're the finest crew I've had the honour to work with. [The Professor opens the envelope.] Oh, my. We're being foreclosed upon. You're all terrible and incompetent!
	Amy	I resent that!
	Hermes	Wait. I found a loophole in the mortgage. If we actually pay it, we can keep the building. We just need... [Hermes turns the page.] Eleven million dollars.
	Bender	And... Boned!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Aw. I suppose there's nothing left to do but move out. Leela, Amy, pack us a lunch for our new lives under the bridge while us men reminisce and smoke some stogies.
	Leela	We are not packing lunches, you walking beer commercials. It was you men who drove this company into the ground. Remember Fry's idea to offer free delivery?
	Fry	It got us a lot of customers!
	Leela	We're a delivery company!
	Amy	If you wanna save this company, you should listen to a woman's idea for once.
	Hermes	Okay. What you got?
	Leela	An airline!
	Amy	Yeah! Wait, what?
	Leela	We should become a commercial airline. I mean, we've got a ship, and teleporters won't be invented for another fifteen years, according to that guy from the future.
	Amy	Wow! That's actually a really good idea for a woman!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Puff! What else you ladies got?
	Bender	[with a female voice] Girls-of-Planet-Express calendar!
	Fry	Girly calendar? Great idea, Amy!
	Hermes	Okay, then. Leela, Amy, come to work topless tomorrow.
	Leela	Forget it! I promised myself I wouldn't pose naked until I was married.
	Hermes	Sorry. It's in your contract. "All female employees must pose nude if requested."
	Leela	That's discriminatory!
	Hermes	No, it's in all our contracts. Here's mine. "All female employees must pose nude if requested."
	Fry	Sounds fun.
	Bender	Back to work, Hermes!
	Scruffy	Now that's what I call fine print.
	Amy	Okay, but good luck making a girly calendar with only two female employees.
	LaBarbara	Oh, husband! I'm so excited about this new job.
	Hermes	And it's excited about you, LaBarbara. First order of business is to put on your uniform and take your ID photo.
	Leela	Look, I agree that it makes space walking more comfortable, but, for a photo shoot, it's a little... Unsavoury. Over.
	Bender	Time is money, peaches. Now shut your com link and make love to the camera. And remember: I'm the camera. [Leela is photographed on top of the ship, LaBarbara, inside a bathtub filled with packages, and Amy, on the conference table with a holographic Saturn. The three girls are then protographed at the same time, scrubbing the ship.] Stop actually washin' and play with the sponges!
	Leela	But the ship is dirty.
	Bender	Uh, whatever. I ran out of film an hour ago.
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, no. This won't do. A three-month calendar? What is this, Mercury?
	Amy	I told you it wouldn't work.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, you should've talked louder. Fortunately, I came up with a brilliant idea to save Planet Express. We'll turn it into a commercial airline!
	Leela	But that was my idea!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Then you should've talked louder. [Nothing is said.] What?
	Leela	There. It was hard work, but it beats posing in demeaning, skimpy modelling outfits.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ladies, here are your demeaning, skimpy stewardess outfits.
	Bender	Sorry, ma'am. I'll have to confiscate your artificial knee cap.
	Hattie	Okay, here you go.
	Fry	Ladies and gentlemen, this is the plane's president speaking.
	Fry	We are cleared for takeoff.
	Leela	You put Goofus and Ganja in charge? I'm the only trained pilot here.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Please, Leela. Who ever heard of a plane with a woman president?
	Bender	Welcome to Plan Am Flight 1 to Acapulsar. The local time on Acapulsar is five years from now. [Victor sets his clock from 3011 to 3016.] In the event of a wormhole sendin' us back in time, do not kill your parents. If you who are travelling with small children, help them not to kill you before not killin' your own parents. Now please turn off all electronic devices.
	Fry	Uh, preparing for takeoff.
	Ben Beeler	I kill you, my friend!
	LaBarbara	[into a speaker] I hope you all enjoyed our timey beverage service. [Petunia waves. Her seat is filled with bottles.] Now sit back and endure our in-flight entertainment.
	Zoidberg	[quickly] Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! [with a normal speed] So what's the deal with airline food, hmm? They offer you two choices, but they're always outta one. Uh, by the way, we're outta both choices.
	Petunia	Shut up and put on four episodes of Da Office.
	Amana	Ooh, your hands are warm... [Bender grabs a bottle of Olde Fortran.] For a Robot.
	Bender	Thanks, baby. I don't know what you're doing back here in the galley, 'cause you got a first-class C.
	Leela	Captain, we were supposed to land two days ago. Is everything— Hey!
	Fry	Are we at the fair yet, Mommy?
	Leela	We're not at the any place! And we're out of fuel!
	Amy	Attention, passengers. Please remain seated until the plane comes to a complete crash.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Perhaps we should reconsider the girly calendar.
	Leela	Flight-attendance log. We've crashed near a river of mercury on a lifeless, mineral world. Supplies are low. Cannibalism, imminent. Radio, busted. Our one hope is to form a society.
	Hermes	Okay, then. Men, let's get hunting. The women folk can cook what we catch.
	LaBarbara	No one put you in charge, husband. I'm the only one here who ever ran a society.
	Hermes	Roller derby is not a society!
	LaBarbara	Well, let's put it to a vote, then. All in favour of the jamooca thunderclap? [All except LaBarbara are confused and looking around.] That would be me.
	Hermes	Practically no one. All in favour of me?
	Dr. Cahill	Eight to eight. It's a tie.
	Prof. Farnsworth	We can't trust a woman's math! Count again!
	Big rock Alien	Greetings, soft ones. Who among you is your leader?
	Men	He is!
	Women	She is!
	Big rock Alien	Curious. You're a diarchic society?
	Hermes	Um, maybe. But, whatever we are, I'm the leader of it.
	LaBarbara	Leader? Fat man, you couldn't even run a bath.
	LaBarbara	Well, you sure can run something: Your mouth!
	Big rock Alien	Silence! Even a young pebble could see your race is divided based on the configuration of your twenty-third chromosome.
	Amy	[confused] You mean, "along gender lines"?
	Big rock Alien	[confused] Gender?
	Sal	Yes. You knows, guyses, galses... In that order. [Leela slaps him.] Ows!
	Big rock Alien	I am not familiar with this concept of gender. My species has only a single gender, known as nuchacho.
	Zoidberg	Interesting. [furiously] Come on, men! Let's kill him!
	Big rock Alien	Your genders differ in many ways, but, as with all things that are different, chocolate and vanilla, Mac and PC, one is always clearly better.
	Bender	Chocolate, Mac, men. The end.
	Big rock Alien	Well, I've got nothing to do for the next eight million years. Therefore, I will administer a series of tests to determine the superior gender. Test number one: Who can drink the most sulfur? Test inconclusive. Test number two: Who can drink the most arsenic?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Just ask us some damn questions.
	Big rock Alien	Very well. Which is larger? An Italian size four or an American apparel medium? [Women.] How many calories are in a small green-tea yogurt. [Women.] Name any twelve of the Desperate Housewives. [Women.] How was your day? [Women. The women cheer.] Test complete. What is the score?
	Bender	Uh... Men, five. Women, less.
	Amana	Hey! He's lying.
	Big rock Alien	Obviously. That was a test to see who could lie better. The men win that round.
	Prof. Farnsworth	In your face, decumbent urinators.
	Big rock Alien	So far, I have learned nothing, but that's probably as much my fault as yours. [enthusiastically] The time has come for the final test.
	Fry	Uh, we usually call it the lightning round.
	Big rock Alien	As you may have noticed, it's getting hotter here.
	Leela	It's nice.
	Fry	It's too hot.
	Zoidberg	[angrily] Would one of you chicks change the thermostat?
	Big rock Alien	Tomorrow morning, this planet makes its closest pass to the sun. You will all be boiled alive like retired circus animals. Unless you somehow can cross the Great Alkali Lake and reach shelter in the Cave of Harmony.
	Fry	That sounds hard.
	Big rock Alien	Which ever gender reaches the cave will survive and may the inferior gender burst into something. Flames, I guess.
	Hermes	Uh-oh. I think we're walking in circles. I recognise the pattern of striations on that Gibson formation.
	Fry	Also, my shoe that fell off.
	Bender	Oh, God. We're all gonna die in agony.
	Small rock Alien	Howdy there. You fellows need some directions?
	Bender	No, we're fine.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Beat it.
	Fry	Don't worry about it.
	LaBarbara	Keep it up, sistren. Only a few more miles to the cave. Let's just buckle down and—
	Amy	Look! A clearance sale!
	LaBarbara	What?! Where?
	LaBarbara	I can't believe that sale was just a mirage. No we're going to die without so much as a factory second-clutch purse to show for it.
	Amy	It would've been nice to shop at Tommy Hilfiger one last time.
	Hattie	It wasn't Tommy Hilfi-gigger. It was Linens 'n Things!
	Petunia	The hell it was! It was a Juicy Couture!
	Leela	I guess we all saw what we wanted to see.
	Hermes	We can't make it tonight. We'll set up camp here by this shoe.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, gentlemen. When that sun rises in the morning, we're toast. These are our last moments together. So, if anyone's got any good fart jokes, now would be the time.
	Amy	It's a schmundered degrees and all we have to drink are non-diet sodas.
	Petunia	It's gonna ruin ma figger.
	Leela	Wait. I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator. If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor, we might survive the heat and make it to the cave.
	Amana	Hey, yeah! But the only gas compressor on this planet is inside Bender's ass.
	Dr. Cahill	Was that a fart joke? Because I don't find those amusing.
	LaBarbara	No one does! Nevertheless, Bender's gas blaster may be our only hope.
	Hermes	Oh! Wife? What are you doin' with Bender's shiny metal, gas compressor?
	UNKNOWN	None of your Biz Markie. Wait a second. What's that UNKNOWN on your DAT bag?
	Hermes	Okay... So we were hot. I stole Amana's freon coil so we could hook it up to Bender's ass and build a cooler.
	LaBarbara	You are no better than me, ya shifty tree skink! How do you live with yourself?
	Hermes	Damn it, woman! You are makin' me highly Selassie.
	LaBarbara	Don't you talk to me that way, you big, hairy Belafonte!
	Hermes	Oh... You cookin' me back bacon. Thank you, woman.
	LaBarbara	That's not back bacon! That's your back bakin'!
	Hermes	Oh, no! We overslept.
	Amy	The mercury's boiling!
	Petunia	Can't breathe... Lungs burnin'...
	Fry	My lucky shoe!
	Bender	Goodbye, cruel me! [Bender.] I learned that from a movie.
	Big rock Alien	I find both genders supremely disappointing. The real reason I administered this bizarre, outer-space test was to teach you to work together! But you couldn't. Thanks to you, I lost my bet with the Borax Kid.
	Fry	Never bet against me being stupid.
	Big rock Alien	Enough! Your gender differences have kept you from achieving harmony. There is only one way to resolve this conflict.
	Fry	Wait. Why didn't that hurt? [Fry screams effeminately.] My wing-wang's gone!
	Leela	My girls!
	Bender	My antenna!
	Hattie	My kajigger!
	Zoidberg	My gonopores! Look it up.
	Big rock Alien	I have freed you from the tyranny of gender. Now go in peace. Or actually stay here. I'll go in peace.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, nuchachos! The ship is nearly repaired.
	Sal	Work goes fasters withouts no secondary sex characteristicses at which to hoot. Now who wants to sing some Christopher Cross songs?
	LaBarbara	I do!
	Fry	Look, associates. I made a hammock from our clothing.
	Leela	How industrious!
	Amy	Do you mind if we sleep with you?
	Fry	I have no opinion. [They.] Well, good night.
	Hermes	Everyone got along so well today.
	LaBarbara	Yes. This place is like a neutered utopia. [LaBarbara gasps.] A neutopia!
	Hermes	I enjoy humour when no one gets hurt.
	LaBarbara	Your companionship is inoffensive, Hermes.
	Hermes	Likewise. Really, what are we missing out on by not having sex right now?
	LaBarbara	Well...
	Hermes	Give us back our genitals!
	Big rock Alien	Is that you, Borax Kid? I've got your fifty bucks. [The Alien turns around and sees the Humans.] Oh, it's you. Why do you want your genders? You seem happier without them.
	LaBarbara	Bein' Human isn't just about bein' happy! It's about lovin' and fightin' and that rasta MacNasty we were doin' last night. [LaBarbara laughs.] We want that back.
	Big rock Alien	Very well. Perhaps it is I who have learned a lesson. Or something.
	Bender	Now what?
	Big rock Alien	I have decided, after little thought, to return your genders.
	Amy	Not cool, bro! Our genders are all reversed!
	Hattie	Now I got a what-ya-call-it instead of a kajigger, you stupid what-ya-call-it!
	Big rock Alien	Okay. Stop yelling at me! It was an innocent mistake. Allow me to rectify it.
	Zapp	I got your distress call and came as quickly as I wanted to. No need to thank me.
	Leela	What's your problem, Holmes? Now we'll be stuck like this forever!
	Zapp	Chill out, dude. [to Fry] Well, hello from the neck down.
	Bender	Thank you for your patronage. We know you have a choice in airlines and you made the wrong one. No refunds!
	Hermes	Aren't we going to cuddle?
	LaBarbara	Woman, I'm tired! I'm sorry. It's just... I need my sleep. I got to get up five times a night to play Xbox.
	Hermes	I understand. Womanhood also takes some getting used to. For example, did you know there are more than two feelin's?
	LaBarbara	I only need one feelin': Love for you, wifey man.
	Hermes	Your manwich!
	LaBarbara	No wonder it's such a mess in there. These bad boys are hard to aim.
	Leela	I hate being a man. I smell bad, my face is scratchy, and the food at those strip clubs is terrible.
	Amy	Crappin' A! Still, I'm sure the women are having an even harder time.
	Bender	OMG! Being chicks is so much fun.
	Fry	Now, when I say stupid things, guys all laugh and buy me stuff.
	Leela	What a skank. Anyway, Planet Express is still facing foreclosure. There's no way we can raise enough money to save this company.
	Amy	Wait. What about the girly calendar?
	Fry	Well, that won't work, remember? We only have three women on staff—
	LaBarbara	"All female employees must pose nude if requested."
	Leela	And it is requested.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Let's just hope we can sell enough of these calendars by tomorrow.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[voice over] We sold enough of those calendars since yesterday!
	Leela	Thank God most of our fans are huge perverts!
	Fry	Who're you, stranger?
	Borax Kid	Well, madam, folks called me the Borax Kid. My friend, the other rock Alien, died without settin' your genitals to right, so I reckon it's up to me to sex you up proper.
	Leela	My girls are back!
	Fry	Ow! Yay!
	Hermes	So what did you like better, my love? Bein' a man or a woman?
	LaBarbara	I don't care what parts I have. As long as they interlock with yours.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, marriage. It combines the contentedness of being neutered with the occasional sex of being not.
	Borax Kid	Well, I'd best mosey on down to the landing. Sounds like the feldspar queen is about to set sail. You folks watch your genitals now. [The Borax Kid.] Come on, boy! Giddy up!
	Leela	And that's that.
	Scruffy	What I miss?
