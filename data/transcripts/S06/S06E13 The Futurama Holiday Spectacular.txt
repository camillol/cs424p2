	Transition Announcer	It's "The Futurama Holiday Spectacular"! Brought to you by...
	Transition Announcer	Gunderson's Unshelled Nuts!
	Amy	Ah, the Xmas season. Who wants a delicious unshelled nut?
	Bender	Ooh, I'll have one!
	Amy	Mmm... "It's NUTSO Good!"
	Fry	Oh.
	Leela	What's wrong, Fry? Are you regretting another wasted year?
	Fry	I don't know. Somethin' about Xmas just doesn't feel like Christmas.
	Professor Farnsworth	Santa's coming! Initiate defenses!
	Robot Santa	God rest ye, merry gentlemen... in peace! [fires his missile]
	Fry	Can someone please explain how you celebrate this crazy holiday? Preferably in song?
	Robot Santa	[singing] It's the violentest season of the year.
	Elf	[singing] And Kringle brought his egg-dispensing mugs of Xmas fear.
	Robot Santa	[singing] Sugar-plummy visions will be dancing in your headWhen I cane you from the comfort of my sled.
	Leela	[singing] On Xmas Eve, we don our gay apparel,Kevlar vests, asbestos stockings and a barrel.
	Professor Farnsworth	[singing] And if Grandma's Xmas fruitcake finally reaches critical mass,It can be regifted straight to Santa's ass.
	Robot Santa	[singing] But the ornamental armaments are merely superficial,The tinsel and the trappings are just icing on the missile.The one thing that you need to make your Xmas day splendiferousIs a pine tree; a pine tree that's coniferous.
	Planet Express crew	[singing] We have to have a pine tree as coniferous.
	Robot Santa	You're welcome.
	Fry	You know, Santa may have killed Scruffy, but he makes a good point. What we need is an old-fashioned pine tree.
	Professor Farnsworth	Cram it, Virginia! Pine trees have been extinct for over eight hundred years.
	Leela	Professor, maybe there's some way to bring the pine trees back to life, like we did the barking snakes.
	Professor Farnsworth	Pine trees aren't barking snakes. They won't just turn up in a salad at Olive Garden. But there is one hope, and, as usual, it's Norwegian!
	Professor Farnsworth	Behold! The Svalbard Global Seed Vault! Since 2008, the vault has preserved seeds of every known plant species in case of extinction.
	Hermes	And I brought a few seeds of my own.
	Norwegian seed guard	Halt! Wh-what's your business poky-pokin' about da seed vault, eh, guardian of mankind's precious botanical heritage dere?
	Professor Farnsworth	We just wanna come in and rummage about a bit.
	Norwegian seed guard	Oh. So... okay. [unlocks the vault]
	Bender	Yo, ABBA, what's that next door?
	Leela	It's so close! Is there any chance of cross-contamination?
	Norwegian seed guard	No.
	Norwegian seed guard	Now, your pine trees were all chopped down to make imirgincee toilet paper durin' th' fifty-year squirts. Lucky da seeds have bin preserved here in da vault der.
	Amy	What's that splork on them? [the camera cuts to a closeup of a tray full of germs] It's not germs, is it?
	Norwegian seed guard	No.
	Fry	Now that's a tree worth chopping down.
	Tinny Tim	Indeed. 'Tis a loverly tree. 'Twould truly be my finest Xmas eve-
	Richard Nixon	Araroo!
	Richard Nixon	That's what my poll numbers need: Happy voters enjoying some holiday cheer.
	Cheney	As your Vice President, I order you to steal that tree.
	Richard Nixon	My fellow Earthicans, welcome to the Annual White House Xmas Tree Lighting, brought to you by Gunderson's Nuts!
	Amy	Oh, no! Could the seed have been contaminated by a virus from the germ vault?
	Norwegian seed guard	Oh, yeh, I suppose.
	Leela	Wait, this could be a good thing. That weaponized virus made the sickly little tree grow big and strong.
	Leela	Wait, this could be a good thing. Reforestation has begun.
	Bender	Aw, jeez with this, hey?(?)
	Leela	Arguably, this could be a good thing. The planet has returned to its primeval state.
	Fry	Earth is just the way it was before the white man came!
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news! All these pine trees are fighting global warming by producing oxygen. Happy now, Gore?
	Al Gore	Yeah, but I'd be happier if I had a set of lungs.
	Professor Farnsworth	Wait a second! Oxygen levels are rising too rapidly! 10%... 20% ...60%!
	Al Gore	As long as it doesn't hit 70!
	Professor Farnsworth	80%!
	Bender	Y'know, I don't recall having done anything for a while. But I still feel like I deserve a smoke. [takes out a cigar and lights it, which causes Gore, Leela and Farnsworth to turn around and gasp, when Bender sees sparks in the air] Hey, cool, the air's on fire.
	Robot Santa	Ho ho ho! Everyone's dead! [cheerfully, to the viewing audience] Stay tuned for another tale of holiday hilarity!
	Transition Announcer	Now, back to...
	Transition Announcer	...the Gunderson's Nuts Holiday Spectacular featuring Futurama!
	Professor Farnsworth	Okay, crew. Xmas break is over. It's time to destroy these gifts we forgot to deliver.
	Bender	Woah, woah, woah! How come we get off for every dumb human holiday but not for robot holidays?
	Leela	Oh, Lord, not Robanukah.
	Bender	I'm talkin' about Robanukah, the holiest six and a half weeks in the robot calendar!
	Amy	Pfft! That's just a fake holiday you make up every year to get out of work.
	Fry	Yeah, if it's real, how come there's no song that explains how you celebrate it?
	Bender	Because there is! Hit it!
	Professor Farnsworth	Hit what?
	Bender	I've placed instruments under your seats. Play 'em or I'll break 'em over your heads!
	Bender	[singing] Robanukah may sound as if it's Jewish,But its ancient sounding customs are exceptionally newish.So take a hearty swallow from your robo-kiddish cup,Which will give me time to quickly make them up.
	Hermes	[singing] Do you spin a dreidel made from clay?
	Bender	[singing] Mine is called a droidel and it's rigged to make you pay.
	Amy	[singing] Do you eat these dummy tin-wrapped chocolate coins?
	Bender	Better! [singing] We got fembots with illegal five-speed groins! [spoken] Shalom, Ruth and Esther!
	Ruth	Why with the music so loud?
	Esther	Would it kill him to turn up the heat a little in here?
	Bender	[singing] But by far the most important thing is oil.
	Leela	[singing] To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil?
	Bender	[singing] No, we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vesselInto this blessed pit so they can wrestle.
	Planet Express crew	[singing] The extra made-up touch that makes Robanukah so specialIs the oil in which the nasty fembots wrestle.
	Bender	We shall now begin the traditional oil wrestling. Will the referee bring out the ceremonial crudes of petroleum oil? [a monkey wearing a referee's outfit and carrying an oil can comes in] Thank you, Abraham. [Bender takes the can and is about to squirt the oil but Ruth stops him]
	Ruth	Not in the hair, please. I just had it did.
	Bender	Aw, no! These broads are s'posed to wrestle for six and a half weeks! But there's only enough petroleum oil for four and a half weeks!
	Esther	We're still gettin' paid, right?
	Bender	I told you it's an audition!
	Leela	Bender, four and a half weeks of oil wrestling sounds like plenty.
	Bender	This isn't a lousy reform Robanukah! We need more petroleum oil!
	Hoschel	I got me some whale oil, some squirrel oil;mdash&
	Bender	Not kosher! It has to be petroleum oil! Do you not give a damn about the hallowed traditions of Robanukah?!
	Hoschel	I reckon I do not. Anyways, Earth done run out of petroleum oil.
	Al Gore	I tried to warn you. [to Hoschel] One unit of free limitless solar power please.
	Hoschel	That'll be... I dunno... ten bucks?
	Al Gore	Um, can you make change for a Nobel Prize?
	Bender	Aw, man! Can't we just make more petroleum oil?
	Professor Farnsworth	I'm afraid not, son. [turns on the hologram projector which shows a grid sphere] Petroleum only forms when organic matter is subjected to intense pressure for hundreds of millions of years.
	Fry	I can't wait that long! I've got ADD!
	Bender	This is so unfair!
	Ruth	I don't wrestle dry, Bender. I went to Vassar.
	Bender	Professor, I want you to look these poor floozies in the eye and tell them their oil wrestling days are over.
	Professor Farnsworth	[sighs] I suppose there could be a minute quantity of petroleum left. But it would be insanely deep within the Earth, at pressures so dangerously high that;mdash&
	Bender	Let's go already!
	Leela	Setting Bachman turners to overdive.
	Hermes	We're getting pretty deep. [gasps] Look! Mole coffins!
	Amy	[Off Screen]: Oh, no! We tunneled into a tunnel!
	Zoidberg	What's that loud, boring sound you'll hear when I stop talking? [A loud, boring sound is heard. Leela adjusts the mirror so that she can see an huge, albino (red-eyed, white) worm-looking thing.]
	Professor Farnsworth	[Gasps] It's an albino humping worm!
	Fry	Why do they call it that? [The ship rocks back and forth; parts of the worm are seen outside the window]
	Professor Farnsworth	Because it doesn't have any pigment.
	Professor Farnsworth	What's our depth, Captain?
	Leela	Forty kilometers. Fifty!
	Bender	There must be petroleum oil down here somewhere. Go deeper! Deeper!
	Professor Farnsworth	No, Bender! The ship can't withstand this much pressure! Sometimes it falls apart just sitting in the hangar!
	Bender	Professor, I've never asked for anything before, but seeing those fembots glistening with oil means more to me than life itself.
	Professor Farnsworth	[Sighs] Oh, call me an old fool, but I believe the lord is speaking through you. [To the rest of the crew] Brace yourselves, everyone!
	Leela	One hundred kilometers! Two hundred!
	Amy	I hate to complain about the heat, but the air conditioner is on fire!
	Hermes	[Is about to bite into a soylent ice-cream snack, but it melts.] My ice cream manwich!
	Leela	What are we doing? We're all gonna die so this "junkyard Golem" can celebrate Robanukah.
	Bender	You vile racist! Haven't my people suffered enough? Now keep drilling for that petroleum oil, you selfish cowards! Although, then again, I guess any kind of oil would be just as;mdash&
	Everybody else	Aah! [The side of the ship that everybody except for Bender is on caves in, killing everyone.]
	Bender	[Looks away] Not my fault.
	Bender	I am so great! Bender is great! Bender, Bender, Bender-- [Takes out the watch from "The Prisoner of Benda".] Man, where'd the time go? [Turns around] Hey, you guys wanna;mdash& Oh. Right. [gasps] They turned into petroleum oil! I thought they were selfish, but in the end it turned out it was I who thought they were selfish!
	Bender	Doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-Doo, DOO!
	Bender	Hey, ladies, I found some... What the;mdash&? [Ruth and Esther are still wrestling in the oil.] There was only enough petroleum for four and a half weeks of oil wrestling. But it lasted for 500 million years! It's a miracle!
	Bender	Happy Robanukah, everyone! Coming up next, some more thoughtful, interfaith hijinx!
	Transition Announcer	And now, the unrelated conclusion.
	Leela	LaBarbara, Hermes, happy Kwanzaa. We brought a chocolate cake. But now I'm worried that might be offensive in some way.
	LaBarbara	Just sit down.
	Hermes	Well, look who the cat the cat dragged in.
	Bubblegum	Kwanzaa tradition encourages educational gifts. So I brought Dwight my book on Mathketball. [He shows them a copy.]
	Dwight	Woah! Let me see that. [He throws it into the trash.]
	Bubblegum	I'll sign it for you later.
	Barbados	Mon, it's a cold one out there.
	Hermes	Barbados Slim?
	LaBarbara	Come in, Barbados. Look at yourself, all throbbing and shirtless for the holiday. I hope you're ready to celebrate.
	Barbados	All night long, woman. [He laughs and walks off with LaBarbara.]
	Hermes	I'm glad you all could be here with my family. Kwanzaa traditions are quite ancient, dating back over 1,000 years.
	Fry	Woah!
	Zoidberg	If only someone could tell us more about these traditions. [He turns to the wall.]
	Kwanzaa-bot	Oh, yeah!
	Dwight	Hey, Kool-Aid's here.
	LaBarbara	No, child. That's not a made-up character. It's Kwanzaa-bot.
	Kwanzaa-bot	And I'm gonna tell you all how we celebrate Kwanzaa. Zoidberg, lay down a beat.
	Zoidberg	How about I just lay down?
	Kwanzaa-bot	The seven basic principles that go to make up Kwanzaa!
	LaBarbara	Kujichagulia...
	Barbados;Bubblegum	And umoja...
	Hermes	And the rest.
	Planet Express crew	Now we get it!
	Kwanzaa-bot	Sit back down! There's gonna be a test.
	Bubblegum	Cooperative economics.
	Kwanzaa-bot	Yo, boondocks, I'm talkin' here! Put away the comics!
	Barbados	Like the ever-changing nature of my sexual proclivities.
	Kwanzaa-bot	I think there's one called "nia," but I don't speak Swahili,
	Professor Farnsworth	That's from Xmas and Robanakuh, you plagiarizing lout!
	Kwanzaa-bot	Yeah, I'm kinda losin' interest here. I'd best be rollin' out.
	Dwight	What's that, Black Santa?
	Kwanzaa-bot	You need seven Kwanzaa candles that you light up every night.
	Planet Express crew	They must be made of beeswax or we might as well be white.
	LaBarbara	Well, we got no beeswax candles, but these scented regular wax candles will do just fine.
	Kwanzaa-bot	Girl, those stink sticks are for single women who take baths. If your Kwanzaa candles ain't 100% beeswax, you bring shame on your people.
	LaBarbara	Well, now that won't do. Husband, show a little ku'umba and fetch some beeswax before Kwanzaa ends.
	Hermes	Sweet candelabra of La Habra, LaBarbara! Isn't this the last night of Kwanzaa?
	Kwanzaa-bot	Who the hell knows?
	Hermes	Finally, a bee farm that's open late on Kwanzaa. Madam, I need beeswax.
	Petunia	You sure you don't need a little honey, handsome? Maybe a taste of sweet nectar straight from the hive?
	Hermes	I just need some beeswax to make Kwanzaa candles.
	Petunia	Well, that's too darn bad. There ain't no beeswax in the whole world.
	Amy	Oh, no! This could be the year without a Kwanzaa, like every year before 1966.
	Petunia	The bees are acting all crazy: like they've been drinking Tang and cough syrup, or as I call it, my Friday night. [She gives a hacking laugh.]
	Professor Farnsworth	[Observing a bee under a magnifying glass.] My God! It's Colony Collapse Syndrome. The bees are swarming with parasites. They're all dying.
	Petunia	Yeah, but what a way to go. "Die young and leave a pretty corpse," that's what I say.
	Bender	You should say someth'n' else.
	Fry	Wait. I know where we can get beeswax. From those giant space bees that nearly killed us, and we swore we'd never go back there.
	Professor Farnsworth	Let's go back there!
	Professor Farnsworth	To communicate with the bees, we'll need to use these trans-bumbalators. Bender, say something in bee talk.
	Leela	I'm sorry, Bender. What do you want me to put on the glass? [Bender buzzes some more.] Okay, if we survive.
	Amy	Something's wrong. It's way too quiet.
	Fry	Like the deadly Prius.
	Professor Farnsworth	Ah, here they come.
	Leela	They're in attack formation. They're going to kill us! [The bees fly in circles and crash, exploding when they hit something.] That was weird. It's like the Jägermeister air show all over again.
	Hermes	According to Google Hive, we're at the exact center of the honeycomb. Oh! And there's a Jama Juice point 2 miles that way.
	Bender	Does that thing tell you where the Queen Bee is? The big, fat, compound-eyed, hairy-thoraxed...
	Queen	[She slaps Bender.] Don't be applying your Eurocentric standards of beauty to me, fool. [Another bee explodes.]
	Hermes	What's with the kamikaz-bees?
	Queen	Man, my hive's been going buck-wild since these blood-ganking butt crabs moved in.
	Zoidberg	Been there, done that.
	Professor Farnsworth	They're all infected, just like the bees on Earth.
	Queen	Brother-sucking parasites gone and disrupted our hivemind. Now, instead of working in harmony, my bees just talk smack to each other.
	Bee #1	Are you all black with yellow stripes or yellow with black stripes?
	Bee #2	Yellow with black stripes, man.
	Bee #1	[He pulls out a rifle.] Why don't you just move along?
	Bee #3	Let me ask you something, you sting my wife?
	Bee #4	What kind of buzzing question is that? Where do you get the wings big enough to ask me that? [They start fighting.]
	Leela	[She scrapes beeswax into a jar.] Okay, gang. We have plenty of beeswax. Let's get back to the ship.
	Hermes	No, we're not going anywhere. I can't abide all this bee-on-bee conflict. It's time to African-Americanize these honeybees. Listen up, bees. It's Kwanzaa, a time of Umoja.
	Amy	It means unity.
	Hermes	You have to learn to work together again.
	Queen	The crazy tablecloth-man is right. It's time to set aside our differences.
	Bee #1	[He puts down his gun.] Black stripe, yellow stripe. At the end o' day, we're just a couple of darn talking space bees.
	Bee #3	Hey, forget about it. Come here and give me a sting. [The parasites start falling off.]
	Professor Farnsworth	Look, the spirit of Kwanzaa is killing the parasites.
	Fry	Yuck, but yay!
	Queen	Thank you, my human brother. Your message of unity has touched our souls. We are once again of a single hive-mind.
	Kwanzaa-bot	Oh, yeah.
	Zoidberg	Hurray! Kwanzaa-bot's here to save— [A squishing noise is heard.] Aw, they killed him.
	Hermes	Joyous Kwanzaa, everybody.
	Al Gore	Don't worry, the Futurama crew will be back next year, with all-new episodes featuring Bender, Leela and me, Al Gore, as Captain Lance Starman. [Amy walks up wearing a Gunderson's Nuts coustume.] And from all of us here at Gunderson's Nuts, happy holidays.
