	Man	Mom on deck! Ten—
	Mom	Alright, grunts. Here's your pre-mission pep talk. [Mom pulls out a gun with her left hand, cocks the gun, turns to the man, and hands the man the gun.] Shoot anyone who doesn't obey hard enough.
	Man	But—
	Mom	Stop gaining knowledge, Hubert! [The camera zooms out, revealing Professor Farnsworth to still have hair and be sitting on a crate. Two other crates read CONTENTS: MORE CRATES. Mom takes the book off Professor Farnsworth's hands and grunts as she rips it apart. The man is behind her.] It's a simple mission. [Mom points at the soldiers with her right hand.] The grunts catch the Alien, the surgeon guts it, and you smuggle the poison parts back here.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Eh, something about poison. Got it. Eh, by the way, that surgeon... [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] Where is he?
	Mom	You! Where's the butcher?!
	Man	Ma'am, I dunno, ma'am. 'Is duffel bag arrived.
	Zoidberg	[off camera] It's not a duffel bag. It's my apartment.
	Mom	Hubert, meet John Zoidberg. [Mom points at Zoidberg with her right hand and then turns to him.] You need an Alien hacked to pieces, he's the best there is. [Mom crosses her arms as she turns to Professor Farnsworth.] In the budget category.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[to Zoidberg] Have you ever dissected a Yeti before?
	Zoidberg	[to Professor Farnsworth] Pfff. [Zoidberg lifts up his right claw and looks at it.] Himalayan or Neptunian?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Tritonian.
	Zoidberg	A Tritonian Yeti?! [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] You two aren't up to anything unethical, are you?!
	Mom	[calm] Relax. [Mom begins walking away.] There's nothing unethical about covert biological weapons research. [Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth look at Mom in suspicion. Mom stops walking and turns to Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth.] [angry, screaming] I said, "Relax."
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, Zoidberg. [Professor Farnsworth pulls a mouse out of his bag and throws it on the floor.] We've known each other so long that... Sometimes, I don't think we even need words to understand each other.
	Zoidberg	What?
	Leela	Once and for all, Fry, even though it's the future, most objects are still just objects. Not Aliens who look like objects.
	Fry	So my efforts to establish diplomatic relations with the cactus people were doomed from the start.
	Zoidberg	So you're in pain and 'ave a bunch o' needles. I prescribe acupuncture. [Zoidberg lifts up a book labelled PRINCIPLES OF ACUPUNCTURE with his right claw.] Let's begin. [Zoidberg hits Fry's right hand with the book. Fry screams.] [scared] Blood?! [casual] I mean, "Blood."
	Fry	Put it back in me!
	Zoidberg	I'm afraid Fry lost a lotta juice. [Zoidberg points forward with his right claw. Leela turns to that direction.] He's developed Simpsons jaundice.
	Fry	¡Ay, caramba!
	Zoidberg	His only hope is some replacement liver. Yours looks like a good match.
	Leela	Well, if it'll help Fry—
	Fry	Careful, Leela! [Leela turns to Fry.] He knows less about Human anatomy than I do. And I can't even find my own uterus!
	Zoidberg	[over the noise, screaming] You may feel a slight sawing!
	Zoidberg	And all we need is a little spine supplement to replace what Leela lost in that unavoidable saw mix-up.
	Leela	It wasn't unavoidable! [Leela jumps forward.] You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled, "Stop! You're cutting my spine!"
	Fry	[off camera] Quit complaining! [The camera pans over to Fry. Fry, whose skin resembles that of Garfield, is sitting on the bed.] My body rejected your liver and now I've got Garfield syndrome. [Fry sighs.] I hate Mondays.
	Zoidberg	Anyhow, Hermes, all Leela needs is one of your vertebrae.
	Hermes	But, Doctor, will I be able to limbo afterwards?
	Zoidberg	Could you limbo before? [Zoidberg laughs.] Wait. I say, "Yes." And you say, "I couldn't limbo before." You ruined the joke, Hermes!
	Zoidberg	There you go, Leela. Good as new!
	Leela	Whoa! Whoa!
	Fry	Oh, sure.
	Leela	[continued] Whoa!
	Fry	[continued] Leela's fine. [Fry points at Leela with his left hand and at himself with both his hands.] But my jaundice has progressed a Muppet gangrene. It's not easy being gangrenous.
	Hermes	I thought you were only gonna take out one vertebra!
	Zoidberg	Yeah, but did you ever play Jenga? Sometimes, you pull one and—
	Fry	[over the noise] Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for ya. I'm not stayin' like this. You're the Doctor!
	Zoidberg	Hmmm. What started out as a pleasant afternoon of drugs and surgery has not gone as planned. But don't worry. We still 'ave three or four coworkers with plenty of spare parts.
	Zoidberg	My first mission. [Zoidberg stops clawing.] I'm so excited. [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth as the camera zooms out, revealing a black-haired man to be to Professor Farnsworth's left.] And, after I dissect the Yeti's poison glands, we can stop maybe for ice cream on the way back? [Professor Farnsworth turns to Zoidberg and smiles.] With sprinkles on?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Why, you're just a big kid, aren't you, Zoidberg?
	Zoidberg	A very big kid.
	Man	We're over the drop zone, gentlemen. Might I suggest you jump out the door and poop yourselves.
	Zoidberg	So, anyway, I hope the men 'ave been taking their hypermalaria pills.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Their wha?!
	Zoidberg	"Their wha?!" [Zoidberg laughs.] That's funny. Like a crazy, old man. But you know what's not funny? [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] Deadly Tritonian hypermalaria. Just be sure to stay outta the methane swamps. [Professor Farnsworth and Zoidberg fall in a body of purple water, where six soldiers have already fallen. Zoidberg smells the air.] What smells like methane?
	Doctor	My God. I've never seen such a gruesome shark attack. [Leela's spine is still showing. Hermes' upper body is connected to his lower body by Scruffy's lower body. Scruffy's head is connected to his left hand. Fry's skin resembles that of a Smurf.] Especially this far inland.
	Leela	It wasn't a shark. It was an awful, incompetent doctor.
	Doctor	Wow. He must've been a total Zoidberg.
	Hermes	It was Zoidberg! He brutalised us with power tools, gypsy curses, and hypnosis!
	Amy	Yes, master.
	Doctor	You'll all get through this. I give you my word as a real doctor.
	Bender	What about me?
	Doctor	What did 'e do to you?
	Bender	I dunno exactly, but... [Bender lifts up his T-shirt, revealing himself to be wearing a diaper.] [whispering] I'm incontinent.
	Doctor	I'm truly sorry.
	Fry	I consider myself a reasonable man. Quick with a joke. Slow to anger. But Bender can't go on long car trips anymore an' I say Zoidberg must die!
	Hermes	People, please! [Hermes raises his arms.] Let's not overreact— [Hermes' body parts disconnect and fall on the floor.] Death to the crab!
	Prof. Farnsworth	How bad is it, Doctor?
	Zoidberg	Super bad. It's Tritonian hypermalaria. [Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth stop walking.] A lot of these men will be dead within twenty-four hours.
	Man	What?!
	Zoidberg	Not you, though! [Zoidberg points at the man with his right claw.] You'll make a complete recovery and go on to marry a super model! [The man sighs in relief and lies down. Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth resume walking.] Funny plague, hypermalaria. [Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth stop walking.] It can kill immediately. Or lie dormant for decades. But, sooner or later, it erupts, causing fever, spasms, madness, coma, and finally... Death.
	Man	What?!
	Zoidberg	Super model!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh! [Zoidberg looks at Professor Farnsworth.] Those poor, doomed bastards. I guess it's up to me to complete the mission.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'll be in the swamp, blowing the smirk off a toxic Yeti.
	Hermes	Professor, we need to talk! [Hermes raises his right fist.] Man-to-mob. [Hermes, Amy, Fry, Leela, Bender, and Scruffy complain.] [over the noise] You need to listen to us! Yes, you do!
	Leela	We've had it with Zoidberg! [Leela points at Professor Farnsworth with her right hand and pokes him in the chest three times.] We demand you fire him!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Nonsense! Zoidberg's a fine physician. [Professor Farnsworth shrugs.] For Aliens. [Professor Farnsworth points at the others with his left hand.] Your mistake is being Humans! No. If I'm going to fire anyone, it'll be Scruffy.
	Hermes	[over the noise] Ya can't do that!
	Bender	[over the noise] What did Scruffy ever do to you?!
	Amy	[angry, screaming] Over my dead body!
	Bender	Don't you get it, old man? [Bender lets go of Professor Farnsworth.] Thanks to Dr. Scissor Hands, I wet myself every time I laugh. [Fry chuckles. Bender turns to Fry.] It's not funny! Well... I guess it is kinda funny. [Bender chuckles.] Uh-oh.
	Hermes	Why are you protecting Zoidberg, Professor? [Hermes points at Professor Farnsworth with his right hand.] Do you owe him something?
	Leela	Is he blackmailing you somehow?
	Amy	What does 'e have on you?! [Amy shakes Professor Farnsworth.] Why have you kept 'im around all these years when 'e's so grossly incompetent?!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Long ago, Zoidberg an' I entered into a secret arrangement relating to certain extraordinary events too horrible to reveal. [The camera stops zooming in on Professor Farnsworth.] [angry, screaming] So there's nothing to be curious about!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[yelling] Stop or I'll shoot! [Professor Farnsworth tries to keep control, but falls to his right knee and stops shooting. We see the dimly lit vastness of the forest and trees with laser-shot holes scattered around. Zoidberg appears crouched with his arms up for cover and steps out of the bushes.] [back to normal, off camera] Zoidberg?!
	Zoidberg	You can't hunt a Yeti by yourself, sir. [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] It's suicidal.
	Prof. Farnsworth	So what?! [Professor Farnsworth raises his arms.] I'm going to die of hypermalaria, anyway. I was in the same swamp as the rest of the men.
	Zoidberg	Just because you were in the swamp, doesn't necessarily mean—
	Prof. Farnsworth	I was thirsty from the flight! I drank swamp water! Look, Zoidberg. [Professor Farnsworth puts his right hand on Zoidberg's left shoulder.] You're a loyal friend.
	Zoidberg	[touched] Friend?!
	Prof. Farnsworth	But I'm doomed. [Professor Farnsworth removes his right hand from Zoidberg's left shoulder.] I might as well capture a Yeti and die trying.
	Zoidberg	Then you'll need someone to dissect it! [Professor Farnsworth looks back at Zoidberg.] Friend.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Go, Johnny! Go! [Professor Farnsworth turns back to Zoidberg.] That's an order!
	Zoidberg	Never! Zoidberg doesn't abandon a friend apparently.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ooh! Ooh-ho-ho!
	Zoidberg	I'll save us! By scaring 'im off with my crazy war noise! [Zoidberg makes a strange sound. The Yeti grabs Zoidberg. Zoidberg screams. The camera pans over to Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth covers his face with his left hand. The Yeti is crunching Zoidberg's head.] Crunch all you want. I'll make more.
	Zoidberg	Oy. [Zoidberg takes off the stethoscope.] I lost another one.
	Leela	[off camera] Zoidberg... [The camera pans over to Scruffy, Leela, Hermes, and Fry, who have just entered. Amy and Bender enter. Fry crosses his arms.] [on camera] I'm sorry to break it to you this way, but we hate you and we never wanna see you again.
	Zoidberg	But, friends—
	Hermes	We're not your friends! We're your victims!
	Zoidberg	I was just trying to—
	Amy	Shut up and give me my kidney back!
	Zoidberg	I'm sorry. [Zoidberg pulls a kidney out of his coat with his left claw.] I'm sorry.
	Fry	We dunno why the Professor keeps you around here and we don't care! [Zoidberg has removed his face from his hands.] [off camera] You're a terrible doctor! [Hermes has crossed his arms. Fry points at Zoidberg with his right hand three times. Amy puts the kidney in her left pocket with her right hand.] [on camera] Nobody wants to see you ever again!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Dr. Zoidberg, I want to see you right now!
	Prof. Farnsworth	The time 'as come, my friend. [Professor Farnsworth walks up to Zoidberg and puts his hands on Zoidberg's shoulders.] We have to talk about... Our arrangement.
	Zoidberg	Oh, no! [Professor Farnsworth approaches Zoidberg. Zoidberg shoves what appears to be a television set on the floor and leans against a table.] No! No! [Zoidberg stands up.] Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!
	Zoidberg	Oh, no!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Unpaw him, you big ape! [Professor Farnsworth grabs a knife from his left boot with his left hand.] I saw this in a Tarzan movie. [Professor Farnsworth jumps at the Yeti.] It was called... [Professor Farnsworth stabs the Yeti. The Yeti grunts.] Tarzan versus the Yetis. [Professor Farnsworth stabs the Yeti. The Yeti grunts.] I lost my virginity... [Professor Farnsworth stabs the Yeti. The Yeti grunts.] Ooh! During the film. So I'm... Hah! [Professor Farnsworth stabs the Yeti. The Yeti grunts.] A little fuzzy on the details. [The Yeti scratches Professor Farnsworth's neck. Professor Farnsworth screams and attempts to stab the Yeti again, but the Yeti, which is holding Zoidberg with its left hand, throws him against the tree.] Oh! [Professor Farnsworth hits the tree, grunts, and falls on the ground. Professor Farnsworth's knife has fallen on the ground as well. Professor Farnsworth stands up and looks at his left hand, which is covered with blood. The Yeti is crunching Zoidberg's head again. Professor Farnsworth, who is holding his knife with his left hand, runs towards the Yeti. The Yeti drops Zoidberg on the ground. Professor Farnsworth jumps at the Yeti. The Yeti falls down. Professor Farnsworth lifts up his head, revealing that he has stabbed the Yeti in the chest and turns to Zoidberg. Zoidberg is rubbing his head. Professor Farnsworth walks up to Zoidberg.] John... [Zoidberg looks at Professor Farnsworth and stops rubbing his head. Professor Farnsworth kneels in front of Zoidberg.] Are you alright?
	Zoidberg	You! [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth.] You saved my life!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, fuff.
	Zoidberg	Yes, fuff. [Zoidberg stands up.] How can I ever repay you?! Do you need a slave? [Zoidberg shrugs.] Or maybe a butler?
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, I haven't needed a butler since grad school. But I do need a doctor. [Professor Farnsworth points at Zoidberg with his left hand.] I don't wanna die like those marines, John. [Professor Farnsworth puts his hands on Zoidberg's shoulders.] The fever! The madness!
	Zoidberg	Don't forget the spasms, coma, and death.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I don't want to go through that! [Professor Farnsworth turns to Zoidberg and grabs him.] I want you to kill me!
	Zoidberg	Alright. [Zoidberg lifts up his left claw.] Give me the knife.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Not now! [Professor Farnsworth lets go of Zoidberg and turns back.] Hypermalaria can lie dormant for years. [Professor Farnsworth turns to Zoidberg.] Isn't that what you said?
	Zoidberg	It sounds like something I would say.
	Prof. Farnsworth	So stay with me until the symptoms start. Then... [Professor Farnsworth puts his right hand on his chest.] Put me out of my misery. You must swear!
	Zoidberg	Alright, Hubert. [Zoidberg puts his right claw on Professor Farnsworth's right arm and smiles.] I swear.
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's started, Zoidberg. The fever. The muscle spasms. [Professor Farnsworth slaps himself twice with each hand.] I'm dying. [Professor Farnsworth coughs aggressively.] It's time for you to keep your promise and kill me.
	Zoidberg	This is very difficult. [Zoidberg opens his eyes.] But I'll try... [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth.] Friend.
	Prof. Farnsworth	No! Wait! [Professor Farnsworth puts his hands on Zoidberg's arms.] I'm afraid to die!
	Zoidberg	Argh! [Zoidberg's fin disappears.] You said you wanted me to kill you! [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] Is this one o' those "No means yes" deals?!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes and no. [Professor Farnsworth stands up and points at Zoidberg with his left hand.] I do want you to kill me. But I mustn't see it coming. That would be agony! [Professor Farnsworth walks up to Zoidberg.] So you must murder me completely by surprise.
	Zoidberg	As God is my witness, you can count on me. [Zoidberg points at himself with his right claw twice.] Well... See you tomorrow.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Not surprising enough!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Eh, wha?! Oh! [Professor Farnsworth screams effeminately and puts his right hand on his chest.] My... [Zoidberg stops approaching Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth grunts.] Heart!
	Fry	Hey!
	Leela	What are you doing there?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Whoa! [Zoidberg grabs Professor Farnsworth's coat.] Whoa! [Leela runs on top of the conference table. Fry runs on the floor.] Whoa! [Leela grabs Zoidberg. Zoidberg is holding Professor Farnsworth's coat. Professor Farnsworth has fallen. Fry grabs the remote control. The song stops playing. Fry makes the remote-controlled airplane fly by Professor Farnsworth.] Whoa!
	Zoidberg	Stop! You don't understand!
	Leela	Let's go, you murderer! Fry, help me lock 'im up!
	Fry	Hang on. I'm learnin' how to do loop-de-loops.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Whoa! Whoa! Woo!
	Zoidberg	You're making a mistake! I was only trying to kill the Professor!
	Bender	Ooh.
	Zoidberg	Hubert... I'm sorry. [Zoidberg grabs a lock of white hair from the coat.] Wha?! He doesn't have hair. [Zoidberg puts the lock of white hair on a microscope and looks inside it with his left eye.] Great Little Caesar's ghost!
	Prof. Farnsworth	You fools! [Professor Farnsworth takes the towel off his head and turns to his left.] You stupid, life-prolonging fools! [Hermes, Leela, Fry, Bender, and Amy are also present. Fry has crossed his arms.] I asked Zoidberg to kill me!
	Amy	Huh?!
	Bender	What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?!
	Hermes	Professor, have you gone mad?!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Probably! [Professor Farnsworth puts the towel back on his head.] It's one o' the symptoms of Tritonian hypermalaria!
	Amy	You mean the incurable disease that causes fever... [Professor Farnsworth squeezes the towel, making a pool on the floor.] Spasms... [Professor Farnsworth punches himself with his right hand, dropping the towel on the floor, punches himself with his left hand, and slaps himself with his right hand.] Insanity... [Professor Farnsworth looks up, laughs maniacally, and kicks the pool four times with his right foot and five times with his left foot.] Coma... [Professor Farnsworth falls over.] And finally death?!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes! And I begged Zoidberg to put me out of my misery! [Professor Farnsworth points at the door with his right hand.] Bring 'im! [Professor Farnsworth violently hits his chin with his right knee, grunts, puts his hands on his chin, and leans back in his chair.] Quickly!
	Scruffy	Hmmm. Should've known better than to store my antiques in the office.
	Leela	Zoidberg, we were wrong! [The door opens.] We're letting you out so you can kill the Professor!
	Zoidberg	[quickly] Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
	Amy	Oh, no! [Amy turns to her left.] He sand-crabbed out!
	Leela	Then we have no choice. We'll have to mercy-kill the Professor ourselves.
	Bender	Well, let's get started.
	Walt	We have a situation, Mother. This creature tried to sand-crab into the building.
	Mom	Zoidberg?!
	Zoidberg	Sorry I didn't call first, Carol. Uh... But I'm in a hurry! I need your help to save Hubert!
	Mom	[to the two men] Let him go [to Larry, Walt, and Igner] and stooge the hell out of here!
	Larry	We're on it.
	Walt	Ow!
	Igner	Ow!
	Larry	Ow!
	Zoidberg	Beautiful kids. You must be very proud!
	Mom	John Zoidberg... It's been a long time. How've you been?
	Zoidberg	Not too bad. [Zoidberg sits down.] Last year, I took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon. [Zoidberg points at Mom with his right claw.] Later, I'll show you the pictures.
	Mom	Do you ever regret it, John? [Mom walks up to Zoidberg and leans over him.] Leaving me to work for the Professor?
	Zoidberg	What do you want me to say? [Zoidberg shrugs.] 'E saved my life.
	Mom	Oh, big deal! You could've been rich if you'd stayed. [Mom points at Zoidberg with her left hand.] Your own lab... A full staff...
	Zoidberg	But Hubert is my friend. [Zoidberg closes his eyes.] 'E's very sick. [Zoidberg opens his eyes and points at himself with his left claw.] I can cure him. But I need the thing! The thing... [The camera zooms in on Zoidberg's face.] From Triton!
	Mom	It'll cost you, John. [Mom turns to her left and lifts up her right hand.] How much are you worth now?
	Zoidberg	I live in a dumpster. [Zoidberg pulls a piece of paper out of his coat with his right claw.] All I have in the world is this coupon for one free session at the tanning salon.
	Mom	[sad] Oh, John. [Mom points at Zoidberg with her left hand.] That's really all you have? [Zoidberg nods.] [happy] Then I'll take it.
	Scruffy	Okay. [Scruffy lifts up the welding mask.] Murdolator's finished.
	Bender	I said I'd kill 'im myself! [Bender raises his arms and then crosses them.] Nobody listens to Bender!
	Leela	We all have to share in the guilt. [Leela turns to Bender.] Which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by.
	Scruffy	Commence mercy-killing... [Scruffy is wearing a cloth with holes for eyes on his head.] In three... [Scruffy lifts up a small flag with his left hand.] Two... [Scruffy pulls down the small flag.] Ayup.
	Hermes	Kill-check one is go!
	Leela	[off camera] Yay!
	Amy	[off camera] Woohoo!
	Fry	Kill-check two is go!
	Humans	Ooh!
	Woman	Wow!
	Hattie	It's about time.
	Female voice	Vegetables activated.
	Bender	Kill-check three is go! Also, the salad's ready.
	Leela	Yay, salad!
	Amy	Yay!
	Zoidberg	[off camera] What the hell are you doing?!
	Leela	[off camera] Zoidberg! [Leela descends through the elevator and runs towards Zoidberg.] [on camera] We know about your secret agreement. [Leela points at herself with both her hands.] I am so, so sorry for how we treated you.
	Fry	And, to make it up to you, we're killing the Professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria.
	Zoidberg	'E doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots! [We hear a growling sound. The camera zooms out, revealing Scruffy and Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth, who has grown white hair, sits up as he growls.] 'E has Yetiism. [Leela, Fry, Bender, Amy, and Hermes gasp. Zoidberg walks up to the bed.] When 'e saved my life all those years ago, 'e was scratched by a Yeti!
	Fry	Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine. [Fry points at the Professor Farnsworth Yeti with his left hand.] And I've never heard of Yetiism.
	Zoidberg	It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly. [The Professor Farnsworth Yeti lies down.] Except for the part where, instead of dying, you turn into a Yeti! [The wheel approaches Zoidberg. Zoidberg avoids the wheel and makes a strange sound. The wheel lands next to a set of logs, above which is a kettle, and its flaming tube burns it. The camera zooms in on the kettle. The water in the kettle begins evaporating.] Wow! [The Professor Farnsworth Yeti begins screaming.] Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote.
	Leela	Another Yeti?!
	Zoidberg	Yes. [Zoidberg looks at the Yeti's head.] The same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast. [Zoidberg pulls a giant bolt out of his right pocket with his right claw.] Now, who's getting 'is pineal gland extracted? [Zoidberg grunts as he extracts a gland from the Yeti's head.] Ah, yes. [Zoidberg holds up the gland.] This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin.
	Hermes	But that's what gave 'im Yetiism in the first place! Won't it just make 'im a double Yeti?!
	Zoidberg	Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!
	Fry	My God. He's like some kinda believable Hulk!
	Zoidberg	No time for an injection. [Zoidberg grabs the gland with his mouth hand, throws the giant bolt away, climbs the Professor Farnsworth Yeti, holds its head with his claws, opens its mouth with two of his mouth fingers, and spits the gland into it. The Professor Farnsworth Yeti closes its mouth, swallows the gland, and throws Zoidberg away with its left hand.] Uh! [Zoidberg hits the wall, makes a strange sound, falls on the floor, and grunts. The Professor Farnsworth Yeti grows in size.] [off camera] I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!
	Amy	[sad] It wasn't supposed to do any of those things.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You did it, Johnny. I'm cured!
	Bender	Wow! [Professor Farnsworth begins getting off the remains. Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth hug. The camera zooms out, revealing Hermes, Leela, Fry, Amy, Bender, and Scruffy. Bender turns to the others.] Alright, let's set it up and try again.
	Prof. Farnsworth	There's one thing I don't understand, Zoidberg. [Leela, Bender, Amy, and Zoidberg are also present. Amy is sitting on the couch's right arm.] How did you persuade Mom to give you her precious Yeti head? Did you 'ave to promise anything in return?
	Zoidberg	[sad] Nothing. Nothing at all.
	Amy	This calls for a celebration! Come on, everyone! [Amy stands up.] Let's go tanning!
	Bender	Hooray!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yay!
	Zoidberg	[sad] I was going to tan... [Zoidberg looks down.] Once.
	Prof. Farnsworth	What do you say, Johnny? [Professor Farnsworth approaches the door.] It's on me.
	Zoidberg	[comforted] Thank you, Hubert.
	Prof. Farnsworth;Zoidberg	[quickly, in unison] Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
