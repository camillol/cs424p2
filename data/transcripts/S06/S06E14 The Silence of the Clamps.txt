	Prof. Farnsworth	Who likes good news? [All but Professor Farnsworth raise their hands.] Everyone. [The camera zooms in on Professor Farnsworth, revealing that the package that he is holding is labelled RUSH.] Then good news, everyone! Our next delivery isn't to some dangerous, outer-space planet. It's to Earth!
	Fry	Earth is dangerous. I fell off my chair there once. [Fry leans back in his chair and falls off it.] Ow! Quit it, Earth.
	Leela	We won't even have to leave New New York! The package is going to Long Long Island.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, to the lavish Mafia-style villa of the Donbot.
	Bender	The Donbot?! [Professor Farnsworth turns to Bender.] The vicious Robot gangster?! [Bender removes the package from Professor Farnsworth's hands.] I'd better use my special Robot vision to see what's inside. [Bender zooms in with his eyes towards the package, perforating it, and then removes them, revealing them to be holding a pair of clamps.] It looks like a pair of clamps!
	Clamps	When are those new clamps gonna get here? [Clamps looks at the clamp and it clamps again.] These are all rusted-out with snitch juice!
	Donbot	Patience, Clamps. [Clamps looks at the Donbot.] It is my eldest daughter's wedding day. [Joey Mousepad looks at the Donbot.] You don't want the Space Pope to see a clampin' now, do ya?
	Clamps	Aw, jeez. I forgot my Pope manners.
	Space Pope	Dearly beloved, [quickly] it is with great speed that I now pronounce you husband and wife.
	Donbot	What the—
	Joey Mousepad	May I help you with some assistance?
	Leela	Delivery for... [Leela looks at the envelope on the package.] Francis X. Clampazzo?
	Joey Mousepad	We don't got nobody here by that alias.
	Clamps	[off camera] Hey! Hey! That's me. [Joey Mousepad and Leela look at Clamps, who is still off camera.] Are those my new clamps?
	Joey Mousepad	Your name's Francis?
	Bender	Guys, look. It's Calculon. And the Robot Devil! [The Robot Devil and Calculon are drinking by a bar.] And an open bar! [The Robot Devil and Calculon make a toast.] What's not to sneak into?
	Leela	Bender, you can't crash a mob wedding.
	Bender	You forget, Leela, I'm Bender, owner of disguise.
	Space Pope	And now, ladies and gentlemen, my good friend... Calculon!
	Calculon	Hey, this one's for the new couple. [Calculon points at the Donbot's eldest daughter and her husband.] It's your day. It's all about you. [singing] Who's that singing at your wedding? It's Calculon! [Both Human and Robot women try to reach Calculon.] Calculon! [singing, extendedly] Calculon!
	Bender	Ay! Oh! Piscopo! [Bender takes a beer bottle from a waiter and points at Mayor Poopenmeyer, who is with the Queen of Yonkers.] This guy! [Bender stops walking, drinks from his bottle, sees the Donbot's eldest daughter, and gasps.] Babba-boing! [Bender's antenna slicks straight. Bender walks over the Donbot's eldest daughter. The Donbot's eldest daughter is dancing with her husband.] Hey, sexy. I'm Bender. What brings you to this tacky soirée?
	Donbot's eldest daughter	I'm the bride!
	Bender	Oops. [Bender slinks away and sees Fanny.] How 'bout you, baby? Wanna do it?
	Fanny	Bender, it's me, Fanny!
	Bender	You who?
	Fanny	The Donbot's wife? We had an affair?
	Bender	An affair, huh? Sounds like me. [Bender shrugs.] [to himself] Jeez, I'd better be a little more careful. I don't wanna hit on anybody I already had sex with.
	Fanny	[to the fembot] Hiya, Bella!
	Bella	Hi, Mom!
	Bender	What about you? You're my third choice.
	Bella	Oh, Bender! This is all happening too slowly. Let's get married!
	Bender	Quiet! I'm makin' out with a floozy! [Bender resumes making love, but hears a noise and stops suddenly.] Hold your clapper. Someone's comin'!
	Calculon	Donbot, please. I'll pay you back as soon as you lend me some more money.
	Donbot	Sorry, Calculon. It gives me no joy to do this... Because Clamps will be doin' it. [The Donbot opens the package and pulls out a pair of clamps.] Clamps, here are your new clamps.
	Clamps	Clamps!
	Calculon	No. No! [Clamps clamps with his left clamp. Calculon looks to his right.] Line? [Clamps clamps with his left clamp again. Bender is still peering from the door in shock as Clamps does his clamping silhouetted.] [off camera, extendedly, screaming] No!
	Bella	Yeah, Daddy hates welchers. The only thing he hates worse is witnesses... [Bender looks horrified.] [musical sting] And guys who mess around with his daughters...
	Bella	[continued] And attempt to duplicate his meatball recipe.
	Leela	How was the wedding, Bender?
	Bender	Says who?! [shouting] I didn't witness anything!
	Morbo	[off camera] In entertainment news, two-time Oscar-pool winner Calculon was brutally clamped yesterday by an unknown assailant.
	Amy	Poor Calculon.
	Bender	[shouting] Alright, Amy, you win! [Bender turns to the table.] The mob did it. I saw the whole thing while also having hot sex with the Donbot's daughter. [Bender begins crying, covering his eyes, and lays on the couch.] I'm scared and great at sex!
	Leela	Bender, you need to go to the police and tell them a tastefully edited version of what you just said.
	Bender	What, and have the Mafia come after me too?! [Bender points at Leela.] No way! [Bender points up.] This secret goes to my grave!
	Male voice	[off camera] The Bureau is offering anyone with information about this gangland-style clamping a fifty-dollar reward.
	Bender	[off camera] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! And— And then Calculon said, "No. No!"
	Bender	[continued, extendedly] "No!" [in a normal tone] And, then, I ate some excellent meatballs. [Bender rubs his belly.] Can I have my fifty bucks now?
	Robot Stack	I enjoyed your story. [Robot Stack presses a button on the voice recorder.] Especially the tasteful love scene. [Robot Stack stands up.] But it's not enough to convict the Donbot. You'll have to testify... In open court.
	Bender	No. No! Can I have another fifty dollars?
	Robot Stack	No.
	Bender	No?
	Robot Stack	No!
	Bender	[extendedly] No!
	Bailiff	All rise for the honourable Judge 723.
	Judge 723	Be seated. Organised crime is a plague on our society and I will not tolerate any form of intimidation during—
	Bailiff	All rise for the honourable Judge 724.
	Judge 724	Good day. I'd like to say I'm prepared to tolerate several, if not all, forms of intimidation during this trial. Prosecutor?
	Hyper-Chicken	Your Honour, the prosecution pecks for a mistrial on the grounds of jury tamperin'!
	Judge 724	Donbot?
	Donbot	Motion denied.
	Judge 724	Prosecutor, call your first witness.
	Hyper-Chicken	The people call our star witness Mr. X, whose appearance will be altered because he's in grave danger.
	Bella	[shouting] Bender, I've been looking for you! Which cake do you like better for our wedding?!
	Donbot	Bender?
	Bender	[quickly] Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! [The bailiff turns the mirror around and the image of Bender's face is diminished. Bender sighs.] That was close.
	Yellow and red lawyer	Isn't it true, Mr. X, that you were slandering this innocent Mafioso to distract from your own felonious past? [The yellow and red manbot walks up to Bender and points at him with his right hand.] Including the crime you made up yourself called burglarcenarsony?
	Bender	That's a wholly-owned trademark of Rodríguez Crime Concepts Inc.! Besides, I'm not on trial here!
	Judge 724	That's true. [Judge 724 turns to Bender.] You're on trial in courtroom three.
	Judge 802	You are charged with two counts of burglarcenarsony. How do you plead?
	Bender	Not inno-guilty-cent!
	Bender	[off camera] And then the Donbot said, "Sorry, Calculon."
	Bender	And then Calculon said, [extendedly] "No!"
	Donbot	I think we've heard enough.
	Bender	Wait, I'm not finished. Oh! [Bender crosses his arms.] Now I'm finished.
	Hyper-Chicken	Your Honour, the prosecution roosts.
	Judge 724	Have you reached a verdict?
	Hedonism Bot	Indeed. After a steamy twelve-way deliberation, we find the accused guilty as—
	Calculon	[off camera] Wait! [Hedonism Bot is surprised. Calculon enters the courtroom wearing plaster casts and crutches and is followed by Joey Mousepad.] The Donbot is innocent!
	Judge 724	Calculon, who is that escorting you?
	Hedonism Bot	Yes. Who?
	Calculon	[hesitatingly] My personal trainer. [Calculon and Joey Mousepad begin walking.] And he's trained me to say that my wounds were self-inflicted. [Calculon and Joey Mousepad stop walking.] For, you see, [in an Italian accent] I'm a big Hollywood idiot dumb guy what does that sorta thing.
	Joey Mousepad	Perfect.
	Hedonism Bot	We find the Donbot...
	Calculon	Dramatic pause...
	Hedonism Bot	[happy, screaming] Not guilty!
	Amy	What?
	Donbot	Honey, if you're marryin' Bender, ya might wanna get a black dress for the wedding.
	Bella	That's gonna look hot!
	Robot Stack	Don't be scared, Bender. We're putting you in the witness relocation programme. [Bender uncovers his eyes.] You'll be given a new identity, a new place to live, and this iPod. [Robot Stack grabs an iPod from his right pocket and hands it to Bender.] I don't want it anymore.
	Bender	So I gotta hide forever?!
	Robot Stack	No. Just until the Robot Mafia finds and kills you. [Fry looks shocked. Robot Stack looks at him.] They're pretty good at that.
	Bender	Goodbye, Professor. [Bender and Professor Farnsworth shake hands.] Before I leave, I just want you to know I've never done any work whatsoever. [Bender walks up to Zoidberg.] Zoidberg, I know it seems like I can't stand you. [Bender walks up to Leela and holds her hands.] Leela, you'll have to watch out for Fry now.
	Leela	Oh, Lord.
	Fry	I wish I could go with you, pal.
	Bender	Me too. I'll need a butler.
	Robot Stack	Bender, we have to go.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[sad] There'll never be another like him. [Professor Farnsworth looks down and the others look at him.] [happy] Let's hire someone better!
	Donbot	Clamps. [Clamps continues staring at the advertisement and says nothing. Joey Mousepad turns to him.] Clamps!
	Clamps	[confused] Huh?
	Donbot	Listen to my boss words. I would like you to apply for Bender's old job and cosy up to this Fry, his best friend.
	Clamps	Yeah. And then I'll introduce 'im to my best friend. [Clamps lifts up his right clamp.] [screaming] Clamp number one! [Clamps looks at his left clamp.] [in a normal tone] Sorry, toots.
	Donbot	No, Clamps. No clamps. Sooner or later, Bender will contact Fry... As relocated squealers always do.
	Joey Mousepad	Then with the clamps... Francis.
	Clamps	Francis? Francis?! [screaming] I'll clamp you with the Francis!
	Joey Mousepad	Ay! Oh! Take it ease.
	Clamps	Hey there, Slick. I'm 'ere about the job.
	Hermes	Take a seat. [Hermes points to his right, where iZac, Helper, the spotty teen Robot, and three other Robots are sitting. A Robot with no limbs is standing on the floor to his left.] We'll begin the interview shortly.
	Hermes	We'll start with Andrew.
	Clamps	Yeah, they all kinda broke. So... When do I start?
	Hermes	Everyone, this is Francis.
	Fry	Hey, Francis.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hello, Francis.
	Leela	Hello.
	Amy	Cute name.
	Hermes	Look what he can do.
	Clamps	Yeah, I do it all. Clampin', crimpin', occasional snippin'.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Snipping? [Professor Farnsworth laughs and turns to Zoidberg.] Looks like you may be out of a job, Zoidberg.
	Zoidberg	That's all good fun. But, of course, a clamp is no substitute for the precision of a genuine—
	Amy	Francis, would you do the honours?
	Zoidberg	[to Clamps, screaming] Stay off my turf!
	Clamps	Eesh. [Fry walks up to Clamps.] That guy can bite my shiny metal clamps.
	Fry	[touched] You remind me of my old friend Bender.
	Clamps	Oh, yeah? Where does he safely live?
	Fry	I dunno. Hey, you wanna come to my house and play?
	Clamps	Yeah. Sounds like freakin' fun.
	Clamps	Four stinkin' years of clampin' school for this?
	Zoidberg	[off camera] Greetings, Francis. [Zoidberg walks up to Clamps. Clamps looks at him.] Sorry if I was a little hostile before, but snipping is the only reason I'm even tolerated around here. Not like you, with those magnificent squeezers!
	Clamps	Squeezers? Squeezers?! [Clamps lifts up his right clamp.] They're clamps, you [beep sound]! [Clamps grabs Zoidberg by the neck and pushes him up against the lockers.] And if I wanna [beep sound]-in' snip with these clamps, I will snip with these [beep sound]-ing clamps! [Zoidberg begins suffocating.] Why do you think they call me— [Professor Farnsworth enters.] Francis?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Eh, Francis, I have good news. It's time for your first delivery... [Professor Farnsworth holds up one finger.] To the Moon!
	Clamps	Fan-[beep sound]-in'-tastic!
	Fry	Here's the two-hundred feet of rope you ordered, Sheriff Burley.
	Sheriff Burley	Hot diggety! You fellas wanna stick around for the hangin' tomorrow? It's gonna be a doozy. [Sheriff Burley points to a muttering eight-headed Alien who is wearing eight moustaches and eight cowboy hats and is holding a mug.] I sure do love hangin' people. [Sheriff Burley signs Leela's pad and pants.] Well, best start cuttin' the nooses.
	Leela	Oh! You know who could help with that?! [Leela looks at the others. Zoidberg walks up to Leela and Sheriff Burley and claws three times.] Francis!
	Leela	Nice job, Francis! I liked how you didn't get drunk and steal anyone's organs. Like our old Robot—
	Fry	Bender?! [Bender is wearing a hat and overall and driving a hovercarriage that is being pulled by the Crushinator. He looks at the crew. Fry runs towards Bender.] Bender! It's me, Fry!
	Donbot	[in the hologram] I knew Bender would turn up purely by coincidence. Take care of 'im, but do it quietly.
	Clamps	Don't worry. We're in space. Where no one can hear you clamp!
	Hermes	What do you know? The Feds gave Bender a new identity as a Moon farmer.
	Fry	Well, he must be afraid to break character in case there's any Robot Mafia scuzzballs around.
	Clamps	Huh?
	Amy	Come on! Let's go check on 'im!
	Clamps	[sad] I checked on a guy once. [angry] I checked 'im into tiny pieces!
	Hydroponic farmer	Bender?! Nope, don't recollect nobody by that name. But let me ask my son-in-law. [The hydroponic farmer turns to his left.] [shouting] Billy!
	Bender	Yes, Moon pa?
	Hydroponic farmer	These nice, big-city hillbillies are lookin' for someone named Bender. You know 'im?
	Bender	No, he ain't any of the eight people I ever met.
	Fry	Bender, it's us, your friends. You can drop the hillbilling moron act.
	Bender	Sorry, mister, but I'm no Bender. I'm just a simple farmer. Name's Billy West!
	Fry	Billy West. What a stupid, phony, made-up name!
	Hydroponic farmer	You city folk are probably hungry from premarital sex and flag burnin'. Y'all wanna stay for supper?
	Amy	Well... [Amy shrugs.] My boyfriend and I were gonna have sex on a burning flag, but... [Amy shrugs again.] I could have a bite.
	Billy West	May I present my beautiful Robot wife, the Crushinator. She's servin' up the dinner and the charm.
	Crushinator	Mashed chicken, Mr. Fry?
	Fry	Sure!
	Clamps	So, uh... Billy... Where were you born?
	Billy West	Right here in Moon country!
	Prof. Farnsworth	And how long have you been a farmer?
	Billy West	Reckon I was born a farmer. Folks say my momma was a hoe.
	Leela	Oh, dear! I seem to have warped my fork! [to Billy West] Could you bend it back for me? Billy?
	Billy West	Bend it? [Billy West tries to lift the fork, but does not succeed.] I can't even lift it. Which is weird... Seein' as how my daddy was a forklift.
	Leela	[to Fry, whispering] Wow! Bender is really committed to his new Jethrovian identity!
	Billy West	If y'all are all finished, I'll drive y'all back to town in the old clunker.
	Billy West	So... Y'all flew here in a spacey-ship?
	Hermes	Stop talking like that! You live on the Moon!
	Fry	[sad] If that is Bender, I guess he's just happier in his new life.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I refuse to believe anyone is happy! Mr. West, would you mind if I examined your brain?
	Billy West	Examine? Heck. If you can find it, you can keep it.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Gadzooks! [Professor Farnsworth enlightens Billy West's head.] Bender's hard drive no longer contains any of his old memories. When the Feds bumpkinised him, they completely wiped out his old identity!
	Billy West	Well, I don't know about that. But who am I to argue with a man from the sky! [Billy West stands up.] So long, space heroes!
	Fry	[sad] You sure you don't wanna kill all Humans?
	Billy West	Pfff! I love all Humans!
	Fry	He really is gone.
	Fry	[sad] I guess I'm happy for 'im. And, honestly, Francis is a way better friend than Bender ever was. [Also present are Amy and Professor Farnsworth, standing up, and Hermes, sitting down.] Hey, where is Francis?
	Billy West	One sasparoil, Sheriff! I'm thirsty!
	Sheriff Burley	Make it two. I'm greedy.
	Clamps	You got the rest fooled. [Clamps turns to Billy West and points at himself with his right clamp.] But not me. [Clamps walks up to Billy West.] Now let's take this outside so's no one else gets clamped.
	Billy West	You're the boss, stranger!
	Clamps	I'm gonna clamp your body parts off one by one. But, then, I'm gonna clamp your wounds shut so ya stay alive... While I clamp ya some more. Say your prayers, stoolie.
	Billy West	Okay! [Billy West folds his hands.] God bless grandma and grandpa—
	Clamps	They're next! Right now, I'm gonna cut your damn head off!
	Zoidberg	[off camera] Drop the Robut. [Clamps looks to his right. Zoidberg claws five times.] I thought I told you. I do the cutting around here.
	Clamps	Scuttle on home. [Clamps points at Zoidberg with his left clamp.] This ain't none of your business, Slick.
	Zoidberg	My name isn't Slick. It's Zoidberg. [Zoidberg looks up.] [screaming] John [beep sound]-ing Zoidberg!
	Fry	Stop, Zoidberg! [Leela looks at Fry with interest.] You'll hurt Francis!
	Clamps	Oh, yeah? Take this! That that!
	Zoidberg	[quickly, repeatedly] Oy!
	Clamps	Why, you lousy— [Zoidberg throws Clamps through a window with HARDWARE painted on it, partially destroying it. Clamps emerges with antennas on his body, shakes them off, screams, and jumps at Zoidberg, making him fall on a water tank. Zoidberg emerges with lobsters on his body, shakes them off, screams, and attacks Clamps.] I'm gonna clamp ya!
	Zoidberg	[screaming] Oy! [Zoidberg's head is almost broken.] Ow. Ow. Ow.
	Clamps	Looks like an all-you-can-kill lobster fest.
	Zoidberg	That offer was for a limited time only.
	Clamps	[screaming, extendedly] My clamps!
	Fry	Why, Zoidberg?! Why?!
	Zoidberg	Because our friend Francis here is in reality... A bad murderer.
	Billy West	Yup. He was fixin' to kill me. [Billy West points at Zoidberg.] This here crawdad done saved my life!
	Bella	Bender, you two-timing jerk! [Bella points at herself with her left hand.] I put off my singing career for you! And, if I can't have you, [screaming] no one can!
	Billy West	Aw, shucks.
	Fry	Bender!
	Leela	No!
	Hermes	What?
	Donbot	Bender was a helluva squealer. [The Donbot takes his hat off.] Maybe the best there ever was. We'll send his widow some meatballs. Clamps, Bella, get in the way-back.
	Fry	To my friend Bender. A wise man once said he was a helluva squealer. [sad] Maybe the best there ever was.
	All	To Bender!
	Bender	[in an Italian accent] You pizzas gonna be another minute. [Bender walks up to the table wearing a moustache and an apron and holding a tray with a bigger beer mug on it.] We are still waitin' for it to be delivered.
	Fry	Bender?!
	Bender	[in an Italian accent] I'm no Bender. You got me mixed up with another Robot.
	Fry	[sad] You're probably right. [Fry shrugs.] I don't really remember what he looks like.
	Bender	Guys! Guys! It's me, Bender!
	Fry	[happy, screaming] He's alive!
	Leela	[happy, screaming] So that Moon hillbilly who got murdered was just an innocent husband and father!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Bender, old bot, the Mafia thinks you're dead! You can come back to work with us!
	Bender	I'm back, baby!
	Brown-haired man	Pizza's here.
	Bender	Woo! [Bender stands up, opens the pizza box, and grabs a cutter from a pocket in his apron.] I'll just cut that.
	Zoidberg	You do and I'll [beep sound]-ing gut you like a fish!
