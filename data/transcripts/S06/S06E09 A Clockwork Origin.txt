	Hermes	Item one... Duck! [Most duck just in time, but Bender is clipped by Cubert on a party board.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Cubert, you crapscallion! What aren't you in school?
	Cubert	I couldn't get past the protesters. A bunch of smiling, angry people were handing out these anti-evolution flyers.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[He gasps.] Evolution is under attack at our schools? To the science mobile.
	Leela	You mean the ship?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes. The science mobile!
	Leela	It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay.
	Woman	I don't understand evolution, and I have to protect my kids from understanding it! We will not give in to the thinkers!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[Walking to the podium.] You people are as loud as you are ignorant. Now, get back on your turnip trucks and go home!
	Hydroponic farmer	[Standing in front of a turnip truck.] That is an insulting accurate stereotype, sir!
	Prof. Farnsworth	As a professor of science, I assure you we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men.
	Dr. Banjo	I can't speak for you, sir, but mine ancestors were not monkeys. They were orangutans. Hard-working, patriotic orangutans.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Dr. Banjo?
	Dr. Banjo	In the fur. And I remind you that evolution is merely a theory. Like gravity, or the shape of the Earth.
	Flying Spaghetti Monster	Hey, Professor, I'm a Flying Spaghetti Monster. You seriously saying that I descended from some kind of flightless manicotti?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes!
	Banjo	Oh, please. A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism. All life was created in its present form seven thousand years ago, by a fantastical creature from outer space!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Bunk!
	Banjo	Oh! [He shows a hologram of a man and a Chimpanzee, with a backwards prohibition sign running through an arrow.] If you elitist, East Coast evolution is real, why has no one found the missing link between modern humans and ancient apes?
	Prof. Farnsworth	We did find it! [The arrow is replaced by Homo erectus.] It's called Homo erectus!
	Banjo	Then you have proven my case, sir, for no one has found a link between apes and this Homo erectus. [The arrow is put between before Homo erectus.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, they have! [The hologram fills in again.] It's called Homo habilis!
	Banjo	Ah-ha! But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so called Homo habilis.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, they have! [The hologram fills in.] It's called Australopithecus africanus!
	Banjo	Oh-ho! I've got you now! [Time Lapse. The hologram now shows 19 different species of ape. Only Fry and Leela are still there.] Fair enough, but where, then, is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae? Answer me that, Professor!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, but just because we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist!
	Banjo	[He scoffs.] Things don't exist simply because you believe in them. Thus sayeth the Almighty Creature in the Sky!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'll show that banana-swilling, poop-slinger! We just need to find that last missing link.
	Leela	I found a missing link. It seems to be half-man, half-toucan. [She shows a human shaped skull with a large beak.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Not what we're looking for. Throw it in the soup! [She throws it in a pot.]
	Hermes	And here's something. [He holds up a fossilized dog] Uh-oh. It's another one of Fry's dogs.
	Fry	Did you say something, Hermes?
	Hermes	[Hiding the fossil behind his back.] Nothing. [The dog lands in the soup.]
	Amy	I hate chiseling right after a manicure. Oh! Darn it! I broke off one of my fingers!
	Zoidberg	[He and Cubert are standing near the fossil of a long-necked reptile.] Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties! [Cubert looks at him, deadpan.] What, too soon?
	Cubert	I highly doubt a Jurassic Elaphrosaurus has access to neckwear.
	Zoidberg	I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke.
	Bender	Hey, look! I found a robot fossil! [He picks up a spring.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's a bedspring, you dumb bedspring! There are no robot fossils!
	Bender	What? Who says I didn't evolve?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Everybody! Robots were invented quite recently. It was in all the papers.
	Bender	Then explain this! [He turns around and works on something. He turns around and shows the Professor. He has put eyes on the spring and mounted it on a plaque that says "I hate Mondays".]
	Prof. Farnsworth	I've hit a rich vein of missing links. Java Man, Piltdown Man, Manfred Mann. [He throws out the skulls as he names them.] Eureka! [He is holding a skull.] It's the elusive missing missing link! This will show Banjo, once and for all!
	Fry	[He scoops up some soup. Amy's finger is in the spoon.] What the...
	Amy	Oh, that's mine. [She takes it back.]
	Bender	[He walks up to the Professor, wearing an under-sized Tuxedo.] Hmm, my tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it, or evolved, one might say.
	Prof. Farnsworth	One might not say that! Your tux doesn't fit is because you stole it from a boy!
	Bender	You mean a man! It was his Bar Mitzvah.
	Ben Beeler	Welcome, museum members. Or, as I like to call you, future exhibits. [The crowd chuckles weakly.]
	Zoidberg	[To Cubert.] He's good.
	Ben Beeler	Tonight, we have a new resident here in the hall of Hominids, generously donated by its discoverer, Hubert Farnsworth. Ladies and gentlemen, Homo farnsworth. [A curtain rises, revealing the skull and an artist's recreation of the hominid.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Once again, science saves the day. The end.
	Ben Beeler	And now, to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery, our new museum curator, Dr. Banjo!
	Banjo	Thank you Professor Farnsworth, for your generous gift, which has, once and for all dis-proven evolution. [He pulls a cord and a painting of Homo farnsworth riding a dinosaur is revealed.] Behold! Homo farnsworth frolicking with dinosaurs at the moment of creation.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Faster! faster! Just drop me off at that asteroid over there.
	Leela	Wow, this planetoid is completely lifeless.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Not lifeless enough! Set up my shack so that I can kick you out of it!
	Fry	[Looking at a polluted pond.] Professor, is this your only water source? It looks like Diet Dr. Pepper.
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's not that bad. It's just laden with toxic minerals. But not for long. [He rattles a tube.]
	Fry	What's in the tube?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Microscopic Nanobots. [He empties the tube. The robots quickly start cleaning the water.] They're tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants.
	Fry	Speaking of nasty irritants, what's going to become of Cubert?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Who? Oh, my son. Don't worry, he's been safely abandoned with his godfather.
	Zoidberg	Cubert, I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple of baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch.
	Cubert	Why don't you just go to Hell!
	Zoidberg	Wait! We still have to discuss the facts of life. What are they?
	Hermes	[He walks out of the Professor's shack.] Okay, I finished moving the last grand piano. Now can we have our pizza?
	Prof. Farnsworth	You'll get your damned pizza, you parasite! First, let me see if my Nanobots have purified the water yet. [He pours some water from an Erlenmeyer flask on to a microscope slide and examines it.] Ah, the water's as sterile as my milkman-trusting father. But what's this? The Nanobots have gotten more complex.
	Bender	What's that you say? Those robots have evolved all by themselves, you say?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It wasn't by themselves! I put them there. I'm a genius. Get over it!
	Amy	Hey look, now they gotten bigger. [The robots are coming onshore.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good heavens! Trilobots!
	Leela	Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there!
	Hermes	Let's get the pizza out of here. [Hermes runs off with the pizza. The crew follows. The Trilobots cannibalize everything, including the Professor's shack and the piano inside.]
	Amy	Look, there's a cave-like hole in that mountain. It might be a cave. [The crew runs into the cave and blocks the door with a boulder.]
	Leela	Does anyone have a lighter?
	Bender	Hang on. [He opens a beer and drinks. He burps and adjusts the flame.]
	Leela	Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation.
	Hermes	It's pizza time. [He passes boxes to the rest of the crew.]
	Amy	Pineapple?
	Hermes	So much for that. [They all throw away the pizza.]
	Zoidberg	Hello, I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall. [He points to a crude drawing of himself and Cubert in costume.] This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working?
	Cubert	This is sucky! You suck! Who taught you to do three-point perspective? I could make a better mural with my butt!
	Zoidberg	[Sadly.] Father-Man away. [He scuttles off. Cubert looks ashamed.]
	Hermes	Nothing like a cave for a good night's sleep. So what do we have to eat that's not poisoned with pineapple?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I packed plenty of food, but it's all in dehydrated pill form. [He holds up a bottle that says "Steak Diner 40mg. Fixin's 10mg".]
	Leela	Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the Trilobots. [Bender moves the boulder.] Go! Go! Hit anything that moves!
	Fry	Whoa.
	Bender	Wow.
	Amy	An entire forest grew overnight.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[He knocks on a tree. It is metal and hollow.] These trees are robotic. I can't believe how quickly they sprung up.
	Bender	I can. Robots do everything faster. Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up.
	Leela	[She gets water from the pond and re-hydrates the pill. It turns into a steak.] One this about Bristol-Myers Squibb, they know how to cook a steak. [She takes a bite.]
	Fry	[In the pond, using a robotic leaf as a boat.] Look at me, I'm the Ty-D-Bol man. I own a yacht an everyone poops on me. [He is attacked by a robotic Plesiosaurs.] Help! Police!
	Leela	Everybody grab a club. [The rest of the crew starts hitting the robot.]
	Fry	[The robot throws opens its mouth and Fry hits the ground, several feet away.] Oh, big, tough water guy, why don't you come up here on land and... [A robotic T-Rex grabs him in its jaws.]
	Amy	Look out for the next thing!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Great Scott, Tricycle-tops!
	Fry	Woo-hoo! Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea. [Something crows and Fry screams. A robot Pterosaur carries him off.] This is a cool way to die!
	Cubert	Dr. Zoidberg? I'm sorry for treating you like a total Zoidberg... I mean, loser. [Zoidberg comes out of his dumpster.]
	Zoidberg	Go on.
	Cubert	It's just that I get bullied a lot. I guess I kinda make fun of people as a defense mechanism.
	Brett Blob	Hey, Cubert, is that your family mansion? [He laughs.]
	Cubert	Why don't you ask your mom? She's coming over for a sex visit.
	Zoidberg	Don't worry, I know just how to handle bullies. Just pretend like you're pathetic. Help, I'm scared. I wet myself. I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee, but what else is new? [He bursts into tears.]
	Brett	[He laughs.] The pee-babies peed themselves. I'm off to pottery class, dorkwads.
	Zoidberg	And that's that.
	Cubert	Woah! You're like some kind of dumpster Jedi.
	Zoidberg	So, you wanna come in maybe? [He opens the other lid.] I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it.
	Fry	[Trying to avoid the babies Pterosaurs.] Ah! Don't eat my butt!
	Leela	If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Look out, a solar flare!
	Amy	What the shmell happened?
	Prof. Farnsworth	A mass extinction. [Fry lands unceremoniously near them.] That solar flare created a huge Electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life, short-circuited the robo-dinosaurs.
	Leela	Convenient
	Prof. Farnsworth	Only puny, mammal-like robots cowering in caves could survive such a catatrophe.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wait a moment. If we could scavenge the right parts from these robo-dinos, I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, well, it took almost two hours, but it's finished. [The crew cheers.] Now let's go... to sleep. It's solar powered, so we can't take off until sunrise.
	Bender	Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on. [Time Lapse. Bender is sleeping on top of Fry, Hermes, and the Professor.]
	Fry	Hey, looky here. [Mechanical flowers have sprung up, there are animals everywhere.]
	Hermes	Sweet robot swan of Botswana!
	Bender	Looks like the fittest did a little surviving last night, huh?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Whatever.
	Fry	Hey, looky there. [Amy and Leela are still being abducted.]
	Hermes	Those robo-cavemen have kidnapped our human regular-women!
	Fry	We gotta save them! But the only weapon we have is my fan dance. [He shows off a fan.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hmm, I believe I can fashion a slingshot using this robot wishbone and this elastic from my pants. [His pants fall down.]
	Amy	I think they want wives, so just play along. If it doesn't work out, we'll still get half their rocks.
	Leela	I can earn my own rocks! Also, I don't want any rocks!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, it took almost twelve hours, but it's finished.
	Hermes	It's too dark now, but first thing tomorrow we'll slingshot them like they've never been slangshat. [They go into their cave.]
	Fry	What's going on? How did we save you?
	Amy	It was the weirdest thing. We went to sleep, and when we woke up, our cave husbands were gone.
	Leela	I'm gonna miss Spencer.
	Dr. Widnar	Don't be afraid, little guys. I'm not gonna hurt you. [She throws a net on Fry.]
	Fry	[He whistles.] Nice net.
	Widnar	You can speak?
	Hermes	Dread my locks! It's a fully-evolved robot human.
	Widnar	I'm Dr. Widnar, a naturalist.
	Bender	And I'm Bender, baby. My human slaves and I come from a planet where organic life and robotic life evolved side by side.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, shut up!
	Widnar	Amazing. [She pokes Hermes.] I've theorized that carbon-based, fat-filled life could exist, but until today, I never had any proof.
	Leela	Good for you. Can we go home now? [Widnar throws a net on Leela.]
	Widnar	Welcome, museum members, or, as I like to call you, future exhibits. [A robot coughs.] I now present my latest discovery, the amazing non-mechanical man, Homo farnsworth.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Thank you. I must say, I'm so proud to see what you've blossomed into since I first created your ancestors.
	Widnar	What?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I thought you knew. You all evolved from some filth-gobbling Nanobots I designed. I dumped them in one of your ponds a few days ago.
	Widnar	But this is Creationist talk!
	Robot Farnsworth	He speaks lies! The Earth was created in eons not days.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, relative to you, it was eons, but, well, look at this hologram I took the day before yesterday of a robot frolicking with a robo-dinosaur. [He shows a hologram of Bender riding one of the dinosaurs. The crowd gasps again.]
	Widnar	I don't want to live on this planet anymore! [She blasts off.]
	Robo-Police	You're under arrest for crimes against science.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[He is dragged off.] No! Could you drag me by the restroom?
	Robot	Go back to Roboklahoma!
	Superior Gort Judge	Order! In the matter of Everyone v. Farnsworth, the alleged creationist faces a sentence of death by melting. Who is representing the accused?
	Leela	I am...
	Bender	I am, your Honor. [Everyone else gasps.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Bender, what the Hell are you doing?
	Bender	Shut up, I'm billing you by the hour! Besides, I'm a robot, they'll listen to me. [He clears his throat.] Ladytrons and gentlebots...
	Superior Gort Prosecutor	Objection. In the absence of pants, defense's suspenders serve no purpose.
	Superior Gort Judge	I'm going to allow them, for now.
	Bender	Thank you. Your Honor, this meat-man does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution. He claim only to have played a small role in providing the initial machinery. I ask you, is that so crazy? Yes, it completely crazy, and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity! [Everyone gasps again.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Objection, I'm not crazy! I created you all and I came here in a homemade spaceship and lived in a cave. If you don't believe me, ask my uncle.
	Superior Gort Judge	Prosecutor, your opening statement?
	Superior Gort Prosecutor	[on cell-phone.] Yeah, honey. I'll be home by dinner. [To the Judge.] The prosecution rests, your Honor.
	Superior Gort Judge	Very well, we will reconvene when the jury reaches a verdict.
	Bender	[To Farnsworth.] Son, you in a whole mess of trouble.
	Superior Gort Judge	Has the jury reached a verdict?
	Robotic gas forms	No, we have not, for we have all evolved into high states of consciousness. [They are all energy beings.] In the grand scheme of things, all physical beings are but yokels. Now, settle your petty squabbles and get the hell out. [A blinding flash occurs and the energy beings are gone.]
	Bender	[To Farnsworth.] That'll be $10,000.
	Banjo	Well, digital photographs don't lie. I admit what you witnessed may have been some form of evolution.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm glad you agree, Dr. Banjo.
	Banjo	Evolution set into motion by a wise and all-knowing Creator. You.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[He chuckles.] Well I don't know about all-knowing. And I admit it's possible, however unlikely, that some wise and all-knowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth.
	Bender	And the Creator could also be a robot.
	Prof. Farnsworth	And who would have built this so-called Creator-robot?
	Banjo	Some magical bearded robot in the sky? [He and Farnsworth laugh.]
	Bender	I guess that would be stupid. Never mind.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Then it's settled. Finally, a world in which I am happy to raise my son!
	Zoidberg	Good, cause I'm sick of him!
	Zoidberg	[Over credits.] I'm serious. He's a terrible person.
