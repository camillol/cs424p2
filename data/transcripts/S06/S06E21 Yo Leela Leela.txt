	Albert	I got one!
	Warden Vogel	Okay, kids. Put away the dust motes 'til tomorrow. [Warden Vogel puts the sign on the painting surface.] It's story time! [Twelve orphans, including Sally, gather and sit on the floor, sounding excited.] Today's storyteller is a space captain who grew up right here at the Orphanarium. Welcome back the bedwetter of building D, Turanga Leela!
	Leela	Hi, kids! [Leela waves.] What book would you like me to read first?
	Albert	We don't got books no more.
	Leela	[confused] What?
	Warden Vogel	He means any more. Look, sometimes you gotta choose between eatin' and reading. [angry] So they ate the books. Just... Make somethin' up!
	Leela	Make something up? Um... Okay. [Leela sits on a small chair.] Once upon a time, there was a... A...
	Sally	Princess?
	Leela	Yes! That! [The orphans sound excited.] A... One-eyed princess in a long, flowing... Tank top. And she lived in a magical, one-room...
	Sally	Castle?
	Leela	Yeah. If you believe the listing agent. Anyhow, one day, the princess went off to... Uh... Tell a story! And, then, that's exactly what she did do that. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.
	Albert	Miss Leela? I have a question!
	Leela	Yes, Albert?
	Albert	That story was bad.
	Leela	That's not really a question.
	Albert	That wasn't really a story.
	Leela	[sad] I'm sorry, kids. I'm not a natural storyteller. [The small chair falls off.] [with conviction] But I promise: I'll make up a better story and come back again.
	Sally	[sad] Please don't...
	Leela	See you soon!
	Leela	I'm sure I've got a great kids' story in me. I just need to think of three of some kind of animal. Concentrate, Leela! Concentrate! [Leela is annoyed by the trombone that Fry is playing "When the Saints Go Marching In" with.] [over the noise, screaming] Fry, I'm writing here! Do you have to play that?
	Fry	[innocently] Yes. [sad] It's the only song I know.
	Zoidberg	Look, friends! I accidentally learned to tap-dance!
	Leela	[over the noise, screaming] Zoidberg, I'm trying toâ€”
	Hermes	Time for my four-twenty-one daiquiri!
	Bender	Guys! Guys! Guess who just got commissioned as a tugboat!
	Amy	Oh, yeah! Pachinko break!
	Pachinko machine	[in a Japanese accent] Tokyo crazy balls! Yes!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ooh, good, Leela. You're here. [Leela looks at Professor Farnsworth.] I'd like to describe my foot pain. [Professor Farnsworth sits down and puts his left foot on the table.] My left has a sharp jabbing throb near the bunion, while the other's got a searing pain like gout. [Leela looks repulsed and covers her ears.] Maybe it's too much albumin because of gravity...
	Leela	Even if I had a pen, I couldn't write under these conditions. [Leela grabs her writing pad and stands up.] I'm going to some other planet, where I can concentrate.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[continued] Searing, searing pain that feels as if it were in a vice.
	Bender	[offended] Well, that was rude.
	Leela	Warden Vogel, I have a new story for the children. [Warden Vogel looks up at Leela.] I'm sure they'll like it more than my last one.
	Warden Vogel	They liked hunger cramps more than your last one. Anyhow, you'll have to wait. The kids are busy right now.
	Leela	Oh. Is the organ-harvesting clown here?
	Warden Vogel	Nah. Rusty comes on Tuesdays now. Today, it's the owner of the Tickelodeon Kids Network.
	Abner Doubledeal	Okay, kids. [Abner Doubledeal points at the children with his right hand.] Get ready to be subjected to our new Fall shows! Mr. Funny Bunny here will gauge your reaction by bombarding your brains with harmless snuggle rays.
	Albert	He gives me a nice, warm feeling in my eyeballs!
	Male voice #1	Popular Slut Club.
	Little girl #1	Oh, my God! [The second little girl takes off her glasses. The first little girl points to something in front of them.] There's Jake Thinkleburg! [The first little girl folds her hands.] He's so hot! [sad] I wish he wasn't my brother.
	Male voice #1	Popular Slut Club.
	Male voice #2	Look! Up on the drive-through menu! It's Captain Mega Meat and his young ward Bottomless Boy!
	Bottomless Boy	Hurry, Captain! [Bottomless Boy points at something in front of them.] A skinny kid needs our help!
	Captain Mega Meat	Supersize me!
	Male voice #3	From the "Rowdy" Roddy Piper daycare centre in Glasgow, Scotland, it's Extreme Toddler Wrestling!
	Abner Doubledeal	Thanks for the brain scans, kids. [Abner Doubledeal steers the shelf as he leaves.] Don't have any children for the next couple of days.
	Warden Vogel	Alright, boys and girls. Enough fun! Your old friend Leela is back with a brand-new story!
	Leela	Hi! It's great to be back. [Leela proceeds to her right.] I think you'll enjoy this one.
	Sally	Please! [Sally raises her right hand.] Can't we just get our organs harvested?
	Leela	It's about some cute, little creatures from a land called Rumbledy-Hump. [Leela puts the mini-piano and the creatures in cardboard on the small shelf, unfolds the piece of cardboard, puts the piece of cardboard on the painting surface, revealing it to depict a landscape with two trees, and sits on the stool.] Kids, let's meet the Humplings! [Leela presses a button on the mini-piano and grabs the creatures in cardboard. The piano starts playing. Two other creatures can be seen. The first creature is orange and the second is both pink and yellow. Leela holds up the red creature.][in a different tone, singing] My name is Lady Buggle and I huggle all my friends. [Leela sticks the red creature to the piece of cardboard and holds up the blue creature.][in a different tone] I'm a silly spring named Doingg and my bouncing never ends. [Leela makes the blue creature jump three times.] Doingg. Doingg. Doingg. [Leela sticks the blue creature to the piece of cardboard and makes the pink and yellow creature jump three times.][in a different tone] They call me Princess Num Num. I'm as sweet as sticky buns. [Leela sticks the pink and yellow creature to the piece of cardboard, holds up the purple creature, and makes it jump three times.][in a different tone] I'm Feffernoose. [Leela removes the red creature from the piece of cardboard and holds it up.][in her own tone, spoken] Hello. [Leela makes the purple creature jump five times.][in a different tone, singing] I'm scared of everyones.[in her own tone, spoken] Oh, Feffernoose. [Leela sticks the purple creature and the red creature to the piece of cardboard and puts her right hand in front of her mouth, holding the orange creature with her left hand.][in a different tone, indistinctively] What about me? [Leela removes the red creature from the piece of cardboard and holds it up.][in her own tone, distinctively] Hey, it's Garbly. Everyone loves him 'cause they can't understand him.[in a different tone, indistinctively] It's nice to meet you.[in her own tone, distinctively, singing] We're here to make you laugh and think and smile and learn and sing.And laugh and learn and smile and think and other happy things.
	Albert	Say more things like that!
	Leela	Okey-doke. One sunny, funny day, there was an unfamiliar visitor in Rumbledy-Hump.
	Leela	[in a different tone, off camera, singing] Today we learned that folks are not as different as they seem. [Leela is holding up the pink and yellow creature and holds up a gorilla wearing a backpack that is connected to his mouth by a pipe and holding a flower with his left hand.][in her own tone] The space gorilla's just like us.[in a different tone] Although I breathe chlorine.
	Sally	Wow! I can't believe you imaginated all that stuff!
	Nina	Will you come back again and tell us more stories and also adopt us all?
	Leela	Of course I'll tell you more stories. [Leela stands up.] I'll go think some up right now.
	Abner Doubledeal	Holy moly! [Abner Doubledeal throws his mask away. Leela enters.] Lady, you don't know me, but my name is Abner Doubledeal.
	Leela	Wait! I know you! You're Abner Doubledeal!
	Abner Doubledeal	I brain-scanned those little nose-pickers during your story. And, sister, their enjoyment glands were squirtin' like Broadway roadkill!
	Leela	[touched] Aw. [Leela folds her hands.] They were?!
	Abner Doubledeal	Say, you seem like a smart mark. [Abner Doubledeal points at Leela.] How'd you like to make it into a TV show? Sign here, 'round this... Uh... [Abner Doubledeal grabs a piece of paper from his jacket.] Supercuts coupon.
	Leela	[sad] I dunno. [Leela shrugs.] Don't I need a degree to write gibberish for toddlers?
	Nina	Come on, Miss Leela! [Leela looks at Nina. Nina points at Leela with her left hand.] Don't be a fraidy cat like Feffernoose!
	Leela	Okay. I'll do it! [Leela raises her right hand.] To show you kids you can succeed at anything. [Abner Doubledeal is holding a pen.] If you just luck out hard enough.
	Abner Doubledeal	[excited] Welcome to the glamourous, big-money world of basic cable TV! [Abner Doubledeal shakes Leela's hand.] [sad] I'm gonna need that pen back.
	Hermes	Working on a real TV show is so exciting! I'm on a mostly natural high!
	Amy	These costumes are gonna make it hard to go to the bathroom.
	Fry	I'm not havin' any problem.
	Abner Doubledeal	We're shooting in five minutes and this Leela broad hasn't even delivered a script yet! Sweet Zombie Jesus! Like it's not hard enough to make a freakin' TV show for under fifty bucks! Damn it, I'll call you back, grandma. Nice of you to show up, toots. I mean that sincerely. It's just that I'm in show biz.
	Leela	Sorry. I went to my quiet place to write. Here's the script.
	Abner Doubledeal	Argh! You writers make me sick. Nice job on the script, though. Places, everyone. Okay. Cheap lights. Off-brand camera. And non-union action!
	Fry	[dressed as Doh-ing] I like ice cream. And I like lollipops. And I like you, Princess Num Num.
	Amy	[dressed as Princess Num Num] Ew! I'm all licky-sticky!
	Fry	[dressed as Doingg] I don't understand. When I like something, I lick it. Like this raccoon.
	Leela	[dressed as Lady Buggle] Doingg! Don't lick things that don't wanna be licked.
	Fry	[dressed as Doing] But how do I know what to lick and what not to lick?
	Leela	[dressed as Lady Buggle] It's very simple. [singing] If it's alive, don't lick it.
	Zoidberg	[dressed as Feffernoose, singing] Like a horse, a turtle, or a cricket.
	Bender	[dressed as Garbly, indistinctively] I like turtles.
	Leela	[dressed as Lady Buggle, singing] So, if you're not sure if it's alive or dead,Poke it with a stick and lick the stick instead.
	Fry	[dressed as Doingg] Now I get it!
	Zoidberg	[dressed as Feffernoose] Ow!
	Leela	[dressed as Lady Buggle] Well, that's all for today. But, before we go, let's do everything we just did two more times.
	Bender	Leela, that was great! Even I have to admire the performance of me, Bender!
	Amy	The show looks so cute. Kids'll love it! And it looks so cruddy, their ironic hipster parents will love it.
	Leela	Thanks, guys. But let's be realistic. We all know any TV show that's even slightly good gets cancelled. Sometimes, two or three times.
	Abner Doubledeal	Leela! Tomorrow's ratings just came in from the future. We're a hit!
	Leela	What?! My show is a hit?!
	Abner Doubledeal	What are you, deaf? It's gonna be bigger than SpongeBot SquareBolts!
	SpongeBot SquareBolts	I interfere with pacemakers!
	Abner Doubledeal	Baby, I hope you like drowning in caviar. 'Cause that is how you're gonna die!
	Calculon	Welcome back to the Young People's Choice Awards. In a moment, the award for Outstanding Sext Message. Bur, first, the nominees for Best New Kids' Show are... Yo Gimme Gimme!, The Adventures of Pit-Bull and Scaredy Squirrel, Dora the Destroyer, and Rumbledy-Hump.
	Fry	I hope you win, Leela.
	Leela	Thanks, Fry. It's nice to have the support of viewers like you.
	Fry	I'm the star of the show.
	Leela	Shh!
	Calculon	And the Slurmie for Best New Kids' Show goes to... Turanga Leela for Rumbledy-Hump!
	Female voice	This is Turanga Leela's first nomination and second time in high heels.
	Leela	Wow. I feel so lucky just to have been nominated alongside so many inferior shows. And, to all my young friends at the Orphanarium, thank you for inspiring me to be your hero.
	Calculon	Slurm her!
	Bender	So wait. You play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star who's also secretly a massage chair?
	Fembot	No. I play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star, but, in real life, I'm a massage chair.
	Bender	Hmmm. You ever made out with a tugboat?
	Leela	Guys, I didn't have time to mention it up there, but I want each of you to know what an honour it is to work with me.
	Hermes	Sweet ego of Montego! Someone build a wind farm in front of her mouth.
	Abner Doubledeal	Leela, I mean this. You're the greatest creative mind since blah, blah, blah-bity, blah. But it's two AM and you still haven't written tomorrow's episode.
	Leela	Well, you can't expect me to write it here, with everyone talking so loudly about how great I am.
	Abner Doubledeal	Sorry.
	Leela	I'm taking the ship to my quiet place so I can be alone. You non-creatives can catch a bus home.
	Fry	Non-creative? Ha! I'll have you know I bedazzle my own underpants.
	Bender	That was a helluva massage. Maybe the best there ever was. Say, where are we? Rumbledy-Hump?! It's real!
	Doingg	I love eating vegetables. Don't you? They're like crunchy, green water.
	Garbly	[indistinctively] I don't like 'em. They're icky-yucky!
	Lady Buggle	Now, now, Garbly. If we don't eat our vegetables, we won't grow big and strong... Like Feffernoose.
	Feffernoose	I have to be big and strong to fight off the monsters.
	Garbly	Did somebody say monsters?!
	Leela	This will make a great episode. But talk slower. I can't type that fast.
	Bender	Well, well, well. You didn't make up that TV show! You just wrote down what these space twerps said!
	Leela	Oh, hell.
	Princess Num Num	Leela said a Rumbledy-Hump no-no!
	Humplings	[singing] Sometimes, when we're mad,We say words that are bad.
	Humplings	[singing] And poo-poo and pee-pee and penis and gay.Those are the ninety-eight words we don't say.
	Bender	My God. You stole all your ideas from those poor, innocent creatures and hogged all the credit?! I underestimated you.
	Leela	Wait! I can explain.
	Bender	Nah, don't ruin it. I'm lovin' the hypocrisy. It's like catchin' an evangelist in a whorehouse. That was the best Christmas ever.
	Leela	You know I hate lying. But those orphans were so proud of me, I couldn't bare to let them down.
	Bender	Pfff! At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity to jump out the whorehouse window with his pants around his ankles.
	Princess Num Num	Who's your friend, Leela? He sure has a shiny metal bumbledy-boop.
	Bender	Aw, they're so cute and harmless. No wonder you feel safe rippin' off their act.
	Leela	Bender! I feel bad enough already.
	Bender	I'm just messin' with ya. I love that you're gettin' rich off of them. 'Cause, now, I can get rich off of you!
	Leela	Oh, Lord.
	Bender	From now on, you give me half the gross or I'll blow your cover.
	Leela	Fine. You'll get your cut. I don't really care about the money, anyway. I just wanna show those poor, disadvantaged orphans that they can succeed in life.
	Bender	Ugh. You are the worst kind of rich person.
	Leela	[dressed as Lady Buggle, singing] Be it parsnips or peppers or kale or zucchini.
	Fry	[dressed as Doingg, singing] I like to relax with a spinach martini.
	Bender	[dressed as Garbly, singing] A-gurgle bufwoozle didoodi houdini.
	All	[dressed as Humplings, singing] 'Cause we love our vegetables.
	Abner Doubledeal	And... Cut! That's a wrap, everybody. Ten-minute break, then we shoot season three.
	Fry	Leela, you may have become a Lady Gaga-esque fame hag, but you sure cheered up those orphans. Nice job.
	Warden Vogel	Thanks so much for inviting us to the taping. The kids haven't been this excited since food day!
	Leela	Aw, thanks. They're my inspiration.
	Bender	But not your only inspiration. Am I right, Leels?
	Albert	Is somebody standing on me?
	Bender	I do love inconveniencing the underclass.
	Warden Vogel	Well, we'll be on our way. After we dig through your trash for aluminum. Okay, kids. Delta pattern. Go! Go! Go!
	Sally	Miss Leela?
	Leela	Yes, Sally?
	Sally	I wanna show you the story I made up. That's Gum Drop, Sticky, Candy Corn, Sour Ball, and Jujube. They're brothers and sisters and they live in Butterscotch Hollow.
	Leela	Sally, that's wonderful. You came up with that yourself? Out of thin air? How?
	Sally	You were an orphan and now you're the best writer ever, so I knew I could write too. Thank you for being my hero.
	Leela	I can't do this any more.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I don't blame you. Having to wear a costume made from a hollowed-out walrus...
	Leela	Everyone, I have a confession. I, Turanga Leela, winner of a Young People's Choice Award, a Peabody Jr, and two Training Emmys, am not what I appear to be. There's something I need to show you.
	Bender	Uh-oh.
	Leela	Continuing my confession, this is the hardest thing I've ever done.
	Sally	Harder than creating the bestest show in the world?
	Leela	I didn't create anything. I stole it.
	Bender	Stealin' is a form of creativity!
	Leela	No, it isn't. Guys! Come on out!
	Abner Doubledeal	Holy moly again.
	Lady Buggle	Oh, hello, Leela. I was just telling my friends how they shouldn't eat food off the floor. Should we sing a song about it?
	Fry	Yes, please!
	Leela	No need, Lady Buggle.
	Abner Doubledeal	Say, what's goin' on here?
	Leela	This planet is the real Rumbledy-Hump. And these creatures are the real Humplings. All I did was write down their adorably repetitious hijinks.
	Sally	You lied? Like Doingg did when he stole Garbly's pet pinecone?
	Doingg	You told them about that?
	Leela	I should've told the truth right away. These simply prairie folk have a simple prairie-ish life here. And I was wrong to exploit it for profit.
	Lady Buggle	I'm as sad as an upside-down smile.
	Leela	You mean a frown?
	Lady Buggle	We didn't have a word for it... Until now.
	Amy	To think I put on an unflattering cupcake costume for you!
	Fry	To think I borrowed money from you!
	Albert	I was gonna ask you to marry me.
	Sally	I guess, if you can't make up stories, I can't neither.
	Leela	I deserve this. And more. Keep it coming!
	Abner Doubledeal	Wait a second. As a big Hollywood TV producer, I think I know how to remedy this ethical lapse.
	Lady Buggle	[singing] So if you don't want a tapeworm or intestinal bug...
	Humplings	[singing] Don't eat pastrami that fell on the rug.
	Abner Doubledeal	And... Cut! Ta-da! We got us a reality show! No writers. No actors. No problem.
	Leela	Doubledeal, this is disgraceful! You can't just rip off their real lives and put it on TV!
	Abner Doubledeal	Wha? Who said anything about rippin' them off?
	Leela	I did!
	Abner Doubledeal	I'm payin' 'em. Gather 'round, gang. Here're your pay checks.
	Garbly	[indistinctively] I can finally afford my speech therapy!
	Feffernoose	And the health plan covers my generic Prozac!
	Lady Buggle	Electricity, plumbing... Our lives are a jillion times better. And it's all thanks to you, Leela.
	Leela	Don't thank me! I should be punished! I've corrupted you and taught the orphans a terrible lesson.
	Warden Vogel	What orphans?! The kids were all adopted!
	Leela	They were?! By who?!
	Abner Doubledeal	Come on, kids. Let's get this place cleaned up for the next episode. Albert, pick up that pastrami and put it back on the craft services table.
	Albert	You're the boss, Daddy.
	Leela	Oh, God! What have I done?!
	Nina	You've given us a new father and a full-time job! Which is more than most kids have!
	Leela	Butâ€”
	Sally	We love it here, Miss Leela. This is the funnest planet in the whole world!
	Leela	Don't hug me! I've done a horrible thing! For God's sakes, somebody teach me a lesson!
	Orphans;Humplings	[repeatedly] We love Leela!
	Leela	[extendedly] No!
