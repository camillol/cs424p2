	Linda	[on TV] We now go live to our eye-in-the-sky hovercopter on the scene of that terrible hovercopter crash. Jim?
	Jim	[on TV] [Still in the burning hovercopter.] The scene is not good, Linda. I've just learned that my last words were: back to you, Linda. [The hovercopter explodes.]
	Linda	[on TV] [She laughs] One for the blooper reel.
	Kif	The news is so violent. Let's watch Rachael Ray instead. No, wait. There might be chopping.
	Amy	God, what a wuss. Stop being such a spineless jellyfish.
	Kif	You know full well that I am more closely related to the sea cucumber.
	Amy	Not where it counts.
	Morbo	[on TV] I hated Jim! In other news, our city's urine-soaked walls have been desicrated by a mysterious tile-work graffiti artist.
	Linda	[on TV] Police have no idea who is behind this innovative scourge of public art.
	Bender	[He chuckles maliciously and spreads grout onto a wall. He then makes a tile version of his head] That is one sexy bridge abutment.
	Hyper-Chicken	Free corn? That'll suit me just fine. [He crashes his hovercar and crows loudly]
	Bender	The key is knowing precisely where to strike. [The last building turns out to be URL's back] Oops!
	URL	Well, well. Time to beat him his rights. [He and Smitty take out their lightsabers and being hitting Bender.]
	Smitty	You know, that don't look half bad on your buttocks.
	URL	It does kinda class-up the place.
	Clock	The time is 4 am.
	Amy	We've been arguing all night, Kif. Can't we go to bed?
	Kif	Is that all you ever think about? I'm not just some piece of tofu, Amy. I need to know where we stand in our relationship.
	Amy	We're just going through a rough patch.
	Kif	It is not a patch. It's been ages, according to your wildly inappropriate "Hunk of the Month" calender.
	Todd	Thanks, babe. Also, today is Canadian Independence Day. [He plays a tune]
	Amy	Oh, that's Bender's ringtone. I recognize the smell. Hello? [Bender's picture is displayed over the phone]
	Bender	Yo, Amy, I'm in the slammer.
	Amy	Oh, no!
	Bender	That's enough lip from you, moneybags. Just get 5 grand an bail me out.
	Amy	I don't have that kind of money laying around.
	Bender	Yeah, you do. You know that floor safe where you keep 10 grand? There's 5 grand in there. Don't make me wait!
	Roberto	[He walks up to Bender. He is holding a sock] Hey, Bender. Ever kill a man with a sock? It ain't so hard. Ha-HAA. [He stabs at Bender]
	Bender	I better carve a shiv for protection. [He pulls out a stick and a switchblade. He starts whittling down the stick into a crude knife]
	URL	[He opens the cell door. Kif and Amy are with him.] Rodr√≠guez! These two brothers bailed your ass out.
	Bender	Oh! Thank God. [He hugs Kif, causing his head to inflate] Tell me, have things changed on the outside. Is food finally in pill form? What about pills? Are they in food form?
	Larry the Murder Burglar	[To Amy] Hey, hot stuff. I'm Larry the Murder Burglar.
	Amy	Hi, Larry. I like your tattoos.
	Kif	Amy, that man's a criminal!
	Amy	I was just checking out his tats. [She looks at a tattoo of Larry jumping out of a house window then lighting it with a molotov cocktail. The house explodes.] Sneato! I have one of my mom. Wanna see?
	Larry the Murder Burglar	Sure.
	Kif	[To Amy] I just don't understand why you have to flirt with every bad boy in sight.
	Amy	Quit exaggerating.
	Criminal	Nobody move, or sweet cheeks here gets it!
	Amy	[Giggling] Oh! You're bad!
	URL	[He performs the Vulcan Neck Pinch on the criminal] Momma said, Spock you out!
	Kif	That's it, Amy. Pardon my language, but I have had it with you ruffling my petticoats. You and I are through. [He walks off. Amy looks heartbroken.]
	Bender	[He is holding the accordion.] Aw! Here's a little song I wrote to cheer you up. It's called, [singing] Let's go already!
	Leela	Here's to Amy, single, lonely, and fabulous.
	Amy	Thanks everybody. Looks like I'm back in the game.
	Bender	Yeah, the game of Old Maid. [He laughs]
	Security woman	Excuse me, sir, are those yours? [Bender is wearing Chewbacca's feet]
	Bender	You're damn right. And, before you ask, this is mine too. [He opens his chest cabinet revealing Lassie. She barks]
	Fry	Tough break, Amy. Are you and Kif getting divorced?
	Amy	No. Technically we were Fonfon rus, so we weren't really married.
	Bender	Wow! The interesting thing about that is [He starts snoring]
	Leela	So, Amy, how can I phrase this delicately? Why did Kif dump you like a sack of yesterday's turds?
	Amy	He says I have a thing for bad boys. It's so stupid.
	Bender	The truth is often stupid. [He blows smoke in her face and sprinkles her with ash]
	Amy	Bender, why do you have to be so mean to me?
	Bender	Shut up, baby, you love it.
	Amy	Don't tell me to shut up! You know what happened to the last guy that told me to shut up?
	Bender	What?
	Amy	That was great.
	Bender	Shut up. [Amy climbs on top of him and they start kissing] Come over here.
	Amy	Remember, love between a human and a robot is taboo. [She takes a brush from Bender's cabinet and fixes her hair.] We can't tell anyone, not even our co-workers.
	Bender	Got it. I'll show the utmost discretion as we get nasty in this glass tube. [They begin kissing]
	Hermes	I think I'm coming down with circusitis. [He sneezes and his face gets traditional clown fare: make-up, orange wig, and rubber nose.]
	Leela	I thought circusitis only affected children.
	Hermes	Children of all ages.
	Zoidberg	Bender, old friend. What's on your face?
	Bender	[He has a lipstick mark on his face. He covers it up.] Uh. Blood. You know, from shaving of the face-beard.
	Fry	Amy, are those gear imprints on your sweatpants?
	Amy	Uh, maybe. So what?
	Fry	I only brought it up because Bender is wearing them.
	Bender	[He clears his throat] Uh, I stole them from her. Yeah, that's it, call the cops.
	Hermes	Oh, my swollen feet. He takes his feet out of the tub of water. They have turned into clown shoes] I better take my pills. [He opens the container and rubber springs fly out]
	Bender	Amy, I reckon sweet talk don't come natural to me, but of everyone I've ever dated, you are probably in the top ten.
	Amy	Aw, you always say just the wrong thing in just the right way. [They kiss]
	Preacherbot	Sinners! Robosexuality is an abomination!
	Bender	Oy, this guy.
	Preacherbot	The good book sayeth a robot shall not lie down with a human, nor do it standing up, nor any angle in between.
	Bender	Look! A single mother! Let's get her! [The crowd runs off]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Quickly, into the ship's basement! [Dr. Zoidberg scrambles into the basement and closes the door behind him. Everyone else is already there.] Now, then, as you all know, the county fair is approaching once again, so I'm preparing my entry of pickled winds and weathers. [Pan over the individual jars of weather] I've got sunny, snow flurry, hail with onions, even my grandmother's cranberry-raisin typhoon, but no tornado. I'll be damned if I let Mrs. Girdleson take the blue ribbon again. [He opens some blinds revealing a farmhouse being blown away in a tornado, it has Bender's graffiti on it.] That's why I need you folks to get out there and harvest a nice ripe one. This cattle prod should help.
	Leela	How is that? [The Professor zaps with the prod and she screams.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Get out there!
	Leela	Is everybody in position?
	Amy	What?
	Zoidberg	Is someone talking?
	Leela	Okay, good. On three. One.
	Hermes	What did she say?
	Leela	Two.
	Bender	Wait, I'm not in position. [He is being blown around by the winds]
	Leela	Three.
	Zoidberg	I'm ready for the countdown.
	Leela	I'm not hearing anyone! Abort mission!
	Fry	She said, "Go!"
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good work, everyone. [A tornado has somehow been shoved into a large tube. It is attached to a pickle jar by a hose.]
	Leela	Honestly, that went better than I expected.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I just need to reduce it down into this pickle jar, toss in a bay leaf to impress those stupid judges. [He puts the leaf into the pickle jar.]
	Fry	Hey, where's Amy and Bender?
	Zoidberg	They're missing out on some hot pickle action. [He licks his mouth flaps.]
	Hermes	Sounds like a muskrat's caught in there.
	Leela	That's Amy's sweatshirt!
	Fry	And that's Bender's hat from the Player's ball!
	Hermes	Sweet tornadoes of Barbados! Bender and Amy have been torn to shreds!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[He presses a few more buttons and more of Bender's and Amy's things appear in the whirlwind.] Oh, the humanity! Also Bender!
	Amy	[The whirlwind whips faster revealing Bender and Amy. The tornado stops and they fall to the floor, still kissing.] Uh-oh!
	Prof. Farnsworth	What's going on here?
	Bender	Uh. [He antenna recedes.] Nothing.
	Prof. Farnsworth	A pair of deviant robosexuals. Not under my roof!
	Bender	What about on the roof?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Get your mind out of the gutter!
	Bender	What about in the gutter?
	Leela	Professor, there is nothing wrong with robosexuality.
	Hermes	Yeah, when the lights go out, it's nobody's business what happens between two consenting adults.
	Zoidberg	Or one!
	Amy	Thanks, guys. Everything will be okay just as long as my parents don't find out.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Zai jian. [He hangs up his cellphone and begins whistling innocently and walks to the door. A doorbell rings. He opens it. Leo and Inez are there.]
	Amy	Mom? Dad?
	Leo	Come home, Amy. It your decision. We can't make you. [He pulls out a lasso and lassos Amy] Atta girl!
	Bender	Uh-oh! not the innocent whistling!
	Preacherbot	[The doorbell rings and the Preacherbot is there] Repent!
	Bender	Oy, this guy. [A magnet attaches to his chest cabinet and he is dragged off.]
	Inez	Look, we're your family. And if you can't talk about your problems with us, that would be great.
	Amy	I don't have a problem! I'm in a happy relationship that just happens to be robosex-
	Leo	[Cutting across her.] You finish that word, you kill your parents.
	Wine Bucket	Low wine level detected. [He fills Amy's glass]
	Amy	Thank you.
	Leo	Stop seducing him, you hussy!
	Amy	Dad, gleesh! I'm attracted to Bender, not his emotionless wine bucket!
	Wine Bucket	[A tear rolls down its face] Hopes deleted.
	Preacherbot	Robotic brothers, the path to Robot Hell is paved with human flesh.
	Bender	Neat!
	Preacherbot	Over the course of this escape-proof workshop, your software will be reprogrammed through prayer. And by some tech support guys in India.
	Robosexual Robot	But I read in Esqwired that some robots are hardwired to be robosexual.
	Preacherbot	Don't believe those lies, son! The one ones worth believing are the ones in the Bible. Can I get an "Amen"?
	Hermaphrobot	I'll take a-three-men, holla!
	Inez	Come on, Amy! Pick a male human already! [There is a line of men standing near the porch.] I want to be a grandmother nine months from five minutes from now.
	Amy	Cut it out, Mom! I'm not interested in any of these gross, ugly losers.
	Fry	[Walking up] What about this gross, ugly, smelly loser?
	Leo	Fry! What you doing here?
	Fry	I'm here to rescue Amy, uh... from her robosexual desires. [He winks.]
	Amy	If I understand you correctly, I've seen the error of my ways? [She winks back.]
	Leo	Look at all that awkward winking.
	Inez	It must be love. [Fry and Amy walk off]
	Amy	My parents may be evil, but at least they're stupid.
	Preacherbot	[The campers and the Preacherbot are standing near some dummies of humans.] In this phase, you will literally wrestle with your demons. Your shapely, buxom, human demons.
	Fatbot	Look at the rack on that one! I mean, that one on the rack!
	Preacherbot	[He blows a whistle and the campers each jump on a dummy and start fondling them.] Good! That's real good! [He wipes away some sweat.] Okay, everybody switch demons. No point sticking with just one demon. [The campers all switch dummies.] Now, work it hard! Harder! Till the sin explodes out of you! Mmmm. Mercy. Okay, Lord's work is done. Now, now, cuddle. Cuddle with your demons.
	Bender	Oh, Amy. I wonder where you are right now!
	Amy	I'm inside the dummy to rescue you.
	Bender	That answers that. Wait... Amy? [He begins kissing the demon]
	Leela	[Fry and Leela can be heard groaning] Bender, be careful!
	Bender	Fry? Leela? You're in there, too? Blech.
	Zoidberg	I guess we should have waited in the ship.
	Bender	Listen up, everybody, I love Amy and I'm tired of pussyfootcupping around! I finally found someone I want to spend the rest of her life with. Amy, [He lowers his body and pulls a ring out of his chest cabinet. It has a tag that says exhibit A.] will you marry me?
	Amy	Yes! Yes!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, I'm just glad I didn't live to see this day! Wait a second, [He checks his pulse and hears only one beat] No!
	Zoidberg	[He is admiring Amy's ring] Such a stone. Is it real? [Amy pulls up Zoidberg's coat and uses the diamond to cut through Zoidberg's skin, revealing his internal organs.] Horray!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Horray denied! Need I remind you that robosexual marriage is illegal!
	Leela	Not in Space Massachusetts.
	Bender	You mean Space-tax-achusetts. No chance, stretch pants! We're gonna fight to legalize it right here!
	Hermes	Yeah, man! You got to legalize it!
	Amy	We're talking about robosexual marriage.
	Hermes	We're talking about lots of stuff.
	Fry	Cool! Can you turn into a race car?
	Hot Dog Stand	Nah, I'm just a pre-op transformer.
	Amy	[on stage] Thank you for coming, everyone. We're all having some good, clean fun here.
	Hedonism Bot	[In a bondage outfit] Squeaky, squishy clean! [The Hot Dog Stand vomits hot dogs on Hedonism Bot.]
	Amy	But it's time to discuss a pressing issue, the right to marry who, or what, we want! [The crowd cheers]
	Bender	Every other couple has the right to marry, robot and fembot, [Cut to the Donbot and Fanny, man and woman, [Pan to Pauly Shore and Michelle, man and man [Pan to Randy Munchnik, his partner, and their poodle.]
	Randy Munchnik	Our poodle has two daddies.
	Bender	Interracial, [Pan to two aliens who are half-black and half-white], Interplanetary, [Pan to a blob and a woman], even ghost and horse, [a ghost is floating nearby with a horse inside its body] but not robot and human.
	Amy	That's why we're introducing this ballot initiative to legalize robosexual marriage.
	Bender	If you hate intolerance and begin punched in the face by me, please support Proposition Infinity!
	Linda	[on TV] As election day nears, prop infinity seems doomed to certain defeat.
	Morbo	[on TV] Doomed!
	Linda	[on TV] More fair and balanced coverage after a word from our sponsor, No on Infinity.
	Actor 1	A storm is gathering.
	Actor 2	A storm of robosexual marriage that will rain down on us like fire.
	Actor 1	It's probably a firestorm.
	Actress	If robosexual marriage becomes legal, imagine the horrible things that will happen to our children, then imagine we said those things, since we couldn't think of any. As a mother, those things worry me.
	Man	[Voice over] Vote No on Infinity. Paid for by the Farnsworth Foundation.
	Amy	We can't compete against that much stock footage of clouds! We're boned!
	Bender	But we still have one hope, my big televised debate! I'm our A in the hole!
	Fry	Professor, who's debating for your side?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, that guy, you know, I forget his name.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[Pointing to a live image of himself on a television screen.] That's him!
	George Takei	Good evening, I'm George Takei's head and neck, your host for tonight's debate. You may applaud. [The crowd does.] We flipped a coin before the debate and Bender stole it, so we'll start with him.
	Bender	Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I... Oops. Sorry, force of habit. I support this proposition because I love a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So, please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved.
	George Takei	I haven't heard such an eloquent speech since Bill Shatner explained why he couldn't pay me back. Rebuttal, Professor?
	Prof. Farnsworth	This $4 coffee pot talks about love, but what he describes is perversion.
	Bender	You wouldn't know perversion if it put clamps on your testicles! You're just jealous, 'cause you've never known true love.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, no? Back when I was full of piss and vinegar, and my bed wasn't, I fell in love with the sweetest girl to ever skip through a field of posies. [Flashback to a younger Professor and Eunice skipping through posies.] Her name was Eunice, and we spent our blissful days working in a lab, developing a poison to wipe out that dreadful posy infestation. [Farnsworth handes Eunice some posies and she drips poison on them. They wilt. The Professor and Eunice kiss.] I thought our love would last forever. But then, 43 years later, she left me [Eunice is in bed with a robot.] for a robot! [End flashback] How could she do that to me, her Farnypoo?
	Amy	That's it? You hate robosexual 'cause your girlfriend left you for a robot?
	Prof. Farnsworth	She didn't just leave me for a robot. She was a robot! [The crowd gasps.] Oh, God! Her name wasn't Eunice, it was Unit! Unit 47. [The same flower scene plays but Eunice is replaced with Unit 47.] My heart was broken, and like a bitter, old picklepuss, I took my anger out on robosexuals everywhere. I'm so ashamed! At the risk of losing this debate, I beg you, support Proposition Infinity. [The crowd cheers]
	Bender	Give me a hug. [He jumps the Professor]
	George Takei	I, too, am hugging them in spirit. And now, they're hugging me back. Oh, my!
	Linda	[on TV] In a stunning turnout, voters have approved Proposition Infinity. Robosexual marriage is now legal.
	Morbo	[on TV] What's next, gay robosexual marriage?
	Amy	We did it, honey! Finally, we can have a legal, monogamous marriage, like everyone else!
	Bender	Woo-hoo! Yeah! ... Monogamous? [Cut to Bender on a beach with two hookerbots]
	Radio announcer	And now, a long-distance dedication from a squishy, green bad boy to his pink pork dumpling. [A motorcycle revs outside. Kif is driving and wearing a leather jacket, sunglasses and boots.] At number 12, it's Wailing Fungus with "Shut Up and Love Me".
	Chorus	[Singing.] I told you where.I told you when.I told you how.And we'll meet up at ten.But you keep on talkin'.You keep on yackin'.Chorus: Shut up and love me! Shut up and love me!
