	Bender	[voice over] On the count of three, you will awaken feeling refreshed, as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots, then brought back by bigger idiots. 1... 2... [snaps fingers].
	Bender	[voice over] This has been a test of the Emergency Hypnotoad System. Had this been an actual hypnosis, you would go limp and watch whatever crap comes on next. Comin' up next: Futurama! [snaps fingers]
	Fry	Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.
	Prof. Farnsworth	OK.
	Fry	That's all. [slicks his hair back to normal] [pause] Oh, also; I'm covered with severe burns.
	Prof. Farnsworth	So!? What of it?
	Fry	Well, why is– those things?
	Prof. Farnsworth	You mean you don't remember?
	Fry	Nope, nothing. It's like when I passed out in college, except no one drew magic marker penises on my forehead.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, I suppose it's for the best, considering the unbearable horrors you've endured. Let's never speak of it again. [time lapse] It all began a few days ago. We were interstellar fugitives on the run from the law.
	Zapp	Fire all weapons and open a hailing frequency for my victory yodel.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[voice over; flashback] And so, as you and Leela kissed goodbye in a tender display of toungesmanship, we plunged into a massive wormhole. Never to be seen again.
	Bender	Yeah, we're back.
	Hermes	Sweet coincidence of Port-au-Prince, we're back at Earth!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Of course, that was the Panama Wormhole, Earth's central channel for shipping!
	Zoidberg	How humorous.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes! It's sort of a Comedy Central channel, and we're on it now!
	Amy	I get it!
	Fry	We've lost power to the forward Game Boy, Mario not responding!
	Leela	Brace for emergency landing!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Rodger that, activate Safety Spheres! [The crew activates their safety spheres, which only covers their heads. Except for Farnsworth's, which covers his entire being.] Also mine has air conditioning.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yet, thanks to my trusty safety sphere, I surblibed with only tribial bray dablage.
	Fry	And the others?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Right here behind this horror cloth.
	Fry	Are they dead?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, no no no, much worse.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Move over God! Prepare for rebirth! [He pulls a lever and a ray electrocutes him] Wrong switch. [He switches on a normal light switch]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Come on, stem cells. Work your astounding scientific nonsense!
	Fry	Fetal steam cells? Aren't those controversial?
	Prof. Farnsworth	In your time yes, but nowadays, shut up! Besides, these are adult stem cells harvested from perfectly healthy adults, whom I killed for their stem cells.
	Fry	Hermes Conrad!
	Hermes	[He cries like a baby until Farnsworth slaps his butt] Oh, mon! I'm dripping with placenta! Good thing it's Casual Friday.
	Fry	Amy Wong!
	Amy	Oh, baby soft!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[He slaps her butt] Indeed.
	Zoidberg	Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your umbilical cord. [He cuts off something of Hermes] Oops.
	Fry	And the rest!
	Amy	Hooray, we're back in business!
	Zapp	Over my dead body. [The camera zooms out, revealing his body didn't fall, thus it still being a skeleton] Uh, never mind.
	Fry	[Looking inside] Bender! Are the steam cells working? [Bender's antennae gets out and pokes Fry's eye]
	Bender	[He gets out and speaks with a weak voice] I'm dying. I need mouth to ass resuscitation.
	Fry	I'm on it! [Fry leans down and blows air in Bender's ass offscreen] It's not working!
	Bender	[laughs] I die happy knowing you fell for that.
	Prof. Farnsworth	His power supply is shot! He is flatlining! [He goes to a shelf full of doomsday devices] Only one thing can keep him alive. [He breaks the glass and takes a doomsday device. He goes back to Bender] Possibly this thing. [He turns the device on and puts in inside Bender's chest cabinet. The liquid covering Bender melts and he gets up]
	Bender	Woo! I've never felt so energetic! [He dances]
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's because the doomsday device I shoved all up in you puts out 50 gigawatts. That's ten times your recommended--
	Bender	Who are you? My warranty? [He laughs and sits down. An orange light appears in his body]
	Prof. Farnsworth	For God's sake, Bender! Keep dancing, keep whooping it up! [Bender dances and the light turns off] You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as it produces, or it will build to critical levels.
	Bender	You don't mean...
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, but I do. If you stop partying for a single second, you'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball of melting gears and splattered bowels.
	Bender	Sounds like a party, baby! [He dances]
	Fry	Hey! Speaking of splattered bowels, can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?... Where's Leela? [Leela gets out of the machine] Is she okay? Why hasn't she acknowledged my dinner offer?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Something's wrong! She's not responding to my poking stick. [He pokes her with a stick]
	Fry	Poke harder, damn it!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm poking as hard as I can! I'm sorry, Fry, [He takes out a device] but I'm afraid Leela is in an irreversible coma.
	Bender	[Dancing and singing] Coma, coma, coma, coma, coma, chameleon!
	Fry	My soul mate is gone. Why should I go on living?
	Bender	Because the pain slowly fades but the love is forever. [He is still dancing]
	Fry	But, what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips?
	Bender	Aw! Are you still hung up on Whatshername? Move on already!
	Fry	Maybe you're right.
	Bender	Maybe I'm always right.
	Fry	Build-A-Bot Workshop? It's time to start living again!
	Fry	At least it's something to distract me from Leela. [He adds two eyes] Nah. [One of the eyes falls] Now that I like for some reason.
	Robot Leela	[girl voice] I like jellybeans. Do you?
	Fry	I sure do, honey.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Come now, Fry! You can't live out this sick fantasy! Not without our help.
	Hermes	These security tapes record everything at Planet Express. Including the ship, shower, and urinals.
	Zoidberg	[with toilet paper in his mouth] Maybe he's just trying to feed his family. [ate the toilet paper]
	Hermes	Computer, analyze tapes and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela.
	Computer	Analyzing...analyzing...Checking my eBay bid. [the upper left screen flashes a message saying "Sorry, you've been outbid!"] Dammit. Analysis complete.
	Fry	Hey, I was nuzzling that!
	Robot Leela	Brace for emergency landing! What? We survived the crash? Oh, Fry! [kisses him]
	Bender	Party people in the house say, [gasps dramatically]
	Robot Leela	This is wonderful! The last thing I remember I was dying in an explosion. Yet here I am in the flesh more alive than ever!
	Fry	Alive? [clears throat]
	Hermes	You better tell her, Fry.
	Robot Leela	Tell me what?
	Hermes	Anyway, my work is done. I'm gonna hit the showers.
	Robot Leela	Nibbler, come give mama a hug! [he bites her] Ow! What the—?! Bad Nibbler! Bad Nibbler! [she shakes him off and he takes a piece of flesh from her body] What are you doing, pooperdoodle? It's me, Leela.
	Fry	I swear. I didn't know this would happen. The only thing I truly know is I love you. [holds her hand, but then looks at the real Leela] I mean her—Wait, help me out here.
	Bender	Do the Bender! Do the Bender!
	Randy Munchnik	No thank you.
	Bender	[threateningly] I said, "Do it!"
	Fry	I agree.
	Robot Leela	I need some time to figure this out. Until then, [puts her hand out in friendship] friends?
	Fry	[shaking her hand] Okay.
	Bender	Listen up, disco dummies, you just flunked outta Bender's College for Party Knowledge!
	Bender	Do the back dance! Do the back dance! Ooh....
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone...
	Fry	Really?
	Prof. Farnsworth	[activating some sort of device] No, don't get your hopes up. Frankly, she's just a brainless mound of scabs and pus.
	Fry	[disgusted] Oh! I didn't need to hear that.
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, and you don't need to see this.
	Machine	Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
	Machine	Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!!!! WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, that's it. I'm afraid traditional medicine has failed.
	Fry	No! [runs over to Leela's body with a blernsball bat] I refuse to give up! Wake up, Leela! [hits her with the bat on each word] I! Love! You!
	Robot Leela	Fry, stop. She's gone.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Dr. Zoidberg, can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead?
	Zoidberg	Can I? That's my specialty.
	Hermes	As you all know, Leela's living will states that in the event of coma, her body is to be fed to the wild Cyclophage, a highly endangered creature that eats only cyclopses.
	Bender	[while still partying, holding Leela's wallet and taking her donor card out] Yep, that's what her donor card says. [puts the card back and, as is his nature, steals all the money from the wallet]
	Fry	[kisses Leela] Goodbye, my love. [he sobs heavily]
	Prof. Farnsworth	The beast aproacheth.
	Bender	To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! I'm dancin' a jig wid ma feets y'all!
	Amy	Bender, cut it out! People are trying to have emotions!
	Bender	You think I wanna party? [stops partying] I'm sick of partying! [resumes] Woohoo! More partying! [beatboxes]
	Leela	Bender, shut the hell up!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Bender, stop shutting the hell up!
	Bender	Oh, right. [resumes partying but in a sarcastic way] Leela's back. As if I care. Woo.
	Leela	Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and see— [gasps]
	Fry	Leela?!
	Robot Leela	Leela?
	Leela	[getting out of her coffin] Leela?
	Hermes	Leela.
	Leela	[walking towards her duplicate] How is this possible? And can you believe she wore a tank top to my funeral?
	Robot Leela	Shut up! [grabbing Leela's arm] We gotta get outta here!
	Leela	[grabbing her twin's tank top straps] No, you "Shut up! We gotta get outta here!"
	Bender	All aboard the party ship!
	Robot Leela	There would be if you'd taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma!
	Leela	This is crazy.
	Leela	It's like I'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself.
	Prof. Farnsworth	That is what you're looking at.
	Leela	Oh. How could you do this, Fry?
	Fry	Uh, coma. Sad.
	Robot Leela	I have to go! This is just too freaky! [she exits the room out the door]
	Fry	Don't get upset, Leela. She's nothing like you.
	Leela	I have to go! This is just too freaky! [she exits the room out the door]
	Fry	I need cheering up, Bender. I dunno. You wanna go out and party tonight?
	Bender	[even though he's still partying] I hate partying! If only I didn't have so much crunk in my badunkadunk! Ooh, yeah! Come on, babe!
	Fry	Why does everything I date run away? I love Leela, always and forever. And if I loved Robot Leela, too...
	Fry	...well, that's only 'cause she had so much of real Leela in her. I thought she loved me, too, but, obviously, I was wrong as usual.
	Leela	Wrong again. You were right.
	Fry	Leela? Leela Leela?
	Leela	Leela Leela. I've been thinking, Fry, if I lost you, I don't think I could stand it, either. I'd probably build a copy of you, too. [kisses him] As long as Robo-Leela's not a jealous type like me, thing will wor—
	Robot Leela	I'll kill you, you slut-clops! Hee-ya! [karate kicks her duplicate in the face] He's mine!
	Leela	Oh, back off, missy!
	Amy	Somebody do something! [gives Fry a gun] Here, take this.
	Fry	A gun?! D-Do I really need to—?
	Leela	Shoot her! She's the robot!
	Robot Leela	No, shoot her! She's the human!
	Fry	But-But how do I know who's the human and who's the robot?
	Leela	We just told you!
	Robot Leela	Yeah, you idiot!
	Fry	Okay. Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone. [accidentally drops the gun which shoots at his chest area] Whoa! Right between the lungs. Man, that was close. [screams]
	Fry	I'm a robot, too!
	Zoidberg	[picking up an x-ray of Robot Fry] Aha! That explains this growth on your drive shaft.
	Robot Fry	But how is this possible?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Who knows? Oh, I do. Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed.
	Fry	I'll protect you, Leela! My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Fry did in fact save Leela, though at a terrible cost to himself. I tossed him into the stem cells but he just bubbled away like phlegm on a hot sidewalk.
	Prof. Farnsworth	...then uploaded his personality from the urinal surveillance tapes.
	Fry	[from the tape of him at the urinal] I sure love Leela.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly belly, she had overstuffed him with copper wadding.
	Prof. Farnsworth	The inevitable static discharged electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their short-term memories.
	Robot Fry	So that's why I'm so amazed by these things I already knew.
	Prof. Farnsworth	What could I do? I hung up Leela with the other bone bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew.
	Robot Fry	Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.
	Leela	My god, I can't believe I'll never see that particular Fry again.
	Fry	Hey, where's my shoes?
	Robot Fry	Fry!
	Fry	[putting on his clothes] Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was already here. Wait, what's with all the Leelas?
	Robot Fry	Trust me, don't ask.
	Fry	Okay, dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal, maybe talk about myself a little bit, then—
	Robot Leela	Hang on! It's time to sort things out. The truth is I love Fry. [points to Robot Fry] That Fry.
	Robot Fry	And I love Leela. Any Leela.
	Robot Leela	We're robots and we're in love. Let's ditch these meat jackets.
	Robot Fry	Whoa, cool!
	Robot Fry	[in a voice like a terminator] Hasta la vista, wiener!
	Robot Leela	[also in a voice like a terminator] We'll be back...for our stuff.
	Amy	Why did their voices change?
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's the one thing we'll never truly understand.
	Fry	Uh, this is a bit awkward. Or is it?
	Leela	I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot.
	Fry	Well, you know how I feel. I waited for you for a thousand years. I can wait a little longer.
	Bender	Pffft! What a load of mush! I've had it!
	Amy	He's gonna blow!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Party, Bender! Party for your life!
	Bender	No chance, hot pants! I'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond!
	Leela	The cyclops eater!
	Bender	Hold on, mac! It ain't like that!
	Bender	Geez, what's it take to kill me?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Bender, you blew out your excess capacity! You're cured!
	Bender	[relieved] Oh, sweet mercy. My hellish nightmare is over. I never have to party again.
	Fry	Well, that's that, then. We're back, everyone!
	Bender	Party!!
	Zapp	Wheeee!
