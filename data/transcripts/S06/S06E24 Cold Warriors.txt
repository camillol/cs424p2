	Yancy Fry Sr	Double time, soldier. [Yancy Fry Sr points at the shack, which has a US flag on it, with his left hand.] I want this ice-fishin' operation up and runnin' by oh-eight-hundred hours.
	Fry	It's too cold, Dad. My teen region is freezing off.
	Yancy Fry Sr	You dunno what cold is. [Fry reaches Yancy Fry Sr. Yancy Fry Sr uncrosses his arms, turns to his left, and resumes walking.] I once survived an entire week trapped in a Swiss glacier, eatin' nothin' but frozen Neanderthal. [Yancy Fry Sr turns to Fry.] To this day, I can't stand the taste of early hominid.
	Fry	Let's just get inside the shack.
	Yancy Fry Sr	Hold, maggot!
	Fry	Ow!
	Yancy Fry Sr	Remember the code o' the ice! Thick an' blue, tried an' true. Thin an' crispy, way too risky.
	Fry	Shows what you know. [Fry turns forward and resumes walking.] Crispy doesn't even rhyme with risky. [Fry falls through the ice, screams, and resurfaces.] Help! I'm drowning!
	Yancy Fry Sr	[calm] Don't worry, son. [Fry resurfaces.] You'll freeze before you drown.
	Fry	I love ice fishing.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I shouldn't be out in this cold. I 'ave no protective fat, hair, or warm blood. I'm not even legally a mammal.
	Fry	Pfff! [Fry points at Professor Farnsworth with his right hand.] You dunno what cold is. [Fry turns away from Professor Farnsworth. Amy, Fry, Hermes, Zoidberg, Professor Farnsworth, and Leela resume walking.] I was frozen for a thousand years.
	Bender	You were?! Uh. [Bender resumes walking.] Learn somethin' dumb every day.
	Paper-hatted salesman	Live bait!
	Paper-hatted salesman	Get your live bait here. [The paper-hatted salesman turns to his right. The box is opened by three tentacles. The three tentacles grab the paper-hatted salesman and pull him inside the box, but leave his hat outside.] Whoa! [The box is closed. The paper-hatted salesman's hat falls on the box. The box is opened again.] [off camera] Fresh-killed bait!
	Amy	Can we get inside the shack? [Amy removes her hands from her waist, revealing her belly button to be showing.] I'm wearing a belly parka!
	Leela	If I understand ice fishing, and I'm pretty sure I don't, we'll need to laser-blast a hole in the ice.
	Fry	No. No crazy technology. [Fry grabs a cutting tool with his left hand.] Here. Bender, use your immense Robot strength to drill a hole the old-fashioned way.
	Bender	I don't see any irony in that.
	Fry	And... Woilà [sic]!
	Fry	Everybody's ice-fishing! [Fry looks around.] How come nobody's ice-fishing?
	Bender	Hot-cocoa break.
	Fry	Cocoa is for yodelling babies. [Fry grabs a can labelled LÖBRAU BEER with his left hand.] If you're sober, it isn't ice fishing.
	Fry	Mom, what's my temperature?
	Mrs. Fry	Fifty. Forty-five. [Fry looks around.] Forty. It's all over! [Fry shrieks. Mrs. Fry is watching rugby on television.] Woo! [Mrs. Fry raises her arms and then puts them back down.] Down at the 35!
	Fry	I'm really sick.
	Mrs. Fry	Huh? [Mrs. Fry turns to Fry.] Oh, sorry. [Mrs. Fry looks at the thermometer.] [bored] Hundred-an'-nine. [happy] We'll check again at half-time.
	Yancy Fry Sr	You home from school, you traitor?
	Fry	I fell through the ice! [Fry sits up.] Cut me some slack!
	Yancy Fry Sr	Nobody cut me any slack when I broke my spine. [Yancy Fry Sr points at his spine with his right thumb twice.] Didn't even take a day off o' work. [Yancy Fry Sr crosses his arms again.] Lotta people depend on you when you sell trampolines door to door.
	Yancy Fry Jr	Here's your homework, ya luck knob.
	Fry	And, with a little more luck from my seven-leaf clover, I might get sick enough to miss the whole semester.
	Yancy Fry Jr	Hey, give me that!
	Fry	Ooh.
	Yancy Fry Jr	Come on.
	Fry	No.
	Yancy Fry Jr	Give it to me, ya faker!
	Fry	No. You're not gettin'— [Yancy Fry Jr jumps at Fry, making him and a guinea pig in a cage on the bedside table fall on the floor. Yancy Fry Jr pushes against Fry's chin.] Ow! My underbite!
	Yancy Fry Sr	[off camera] Come on, Yancy! [on camera] Your brother's sick! [Yancy Fry Sr points at Fry with his right hand.] You'll never have a better chance to take 'im out.
	Fry	Dad! [Yancy Fry Jr grunts as he pushes Fry's face against the floor. There is a flyer reading NERD SEARCH '88 SCIENCE COMPETITION.] Nerd Search '88? [Fry turns to his left.] What's this?
	Yancy Fry Jr	Some stupid science contest for smart wads. [Yancy Fry Jr crosses his arms.] NASA's gonna pick one kid's experiment to launch into space.
	Fry	I can make a space experiment. [Fry turns to his left.] I just got a new thing o' glitter!
	Yancy Fry Sr	I'm not sure science is your thing, seein' how that chimp at the zoo tricked you outta your allowance.
	Fry	[angry] Yeah, well, I'll show you. [Fry points at Yancy Fry Sr with his left hand.] [sad] And Mr. Bananas. [back to normal] Anyway, I've got nothin' better to do while I'm sick in bed. Wait. That's it! I'll make a space experiment about the common cold! [Fry looks around.] Where's that contest flyer?
	Yancy Fry Sr	You're holdin' it, genius.
	Fry	Oh, good.
	Fry	[sad] I feel awful. [happy] But it was worth it to catch an' kill this baby fish.
	Amy	Shmeez! [Fry turns to Amy.] What's with the shmiffling?
	Fry	It's nothing. [Fry scratches his nose with his right hand and sniffs.] Just a common cold.
	Zoidberg	Wha?
	Bender	It's a common uh?
	Hermes	Wha?
	Leela	What the hell's a common cold?
	Bender	Is it valuable? Could it be taken from you if you were, say... [Bender lifts up a tube with his right hand and hits his left hand with it.] Unconscious?
	Prof. Farnsworth	A common— [Professor Farnsworth walks up to the conference table and puts his hands on it.] A common cold?! No! [Professor Farnsworth looks up.] [extendedly] No! [Professor Farnsworth looks forward.] [back to normal] Ever since Fry first came to us, I've lived in mortal terror that this would happen!
	Leela	I never heard you mention that.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[calm] Oh, I try to act cool, but inside I'm [stressed] freaking out!
	Fry	It's just a cold! [Fry sneezes aggressively.] What's the big deal?
	Smitty	This is the police. [The camera begins zooming in on URL and Smitty.] An unknown pathogen 'as been detected on these premises. [The camera stops zooming in on URL and Smitty.] Come out with your hands— [Smitty looks confused.] I mean... Stay in with your hands up!
	URL	You are hereby quarantined until such time as it is deemed safe to enter and shoot your asses.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Eh, now, now. [Professor Farnsworth turns to the others.] Let's not all panic at once. We'll have to take shifts. [Professor Farnsworth turns to Hermes.] Hermes, you'll take the first six hours.
	Hermes	Very well.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[off camera] Louder! [The camera zooms in on Hermes' face. Hermes screams louder.] [screaming] Louder! [The camera zooms in on Hermes' face. Hermes screams louder.] [back to normal] Crybaby.
	Fry	Look: I just 'ave a common [screaming] cold! [Fry turns to the male CDC scientist and then to the conference table.] It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out.
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, it won't! [Amy, Bender, Zoidberg, Leela, Professor Farnsworth, and Hermes hide on the side of the table that is opposite to Fry.] The common cold died out five-hundred years ago. And, subsequently, Humanity lost all resistance to its ravages. But the virus survived in you... [Professor Farnsworth points at Fry with his left hand.] [off camera] Frozen for a thousand years.
	Fry	Huh. [Fry turns to his right.] So it was hiding deep down inside o' me? Like my skeleton bones?
	Leela	Give it to us straight, Professor. How incredibly deadly is it?
	Prof. Farnsworth	[worried] We don't know. [Professor Farnsworth shrugs.] It could kill millions or nobody. I suppose it might even bring a few people back to life! [happy] Anything is possible in science.
	Amy	Oh, no! [Amy turns to her left.] I've got it too! [Bender, Zoidberg, Leela, Professor Farnsworth, and Hermes hide on the side of the table that is opposite to Fry and Amy.] My nose is all gunked up with blork!
	Hermes	And I've got a hankerin' for a useless remedy created by a schoolteacher.
	Zoidberg	Uh-oh. I think I'm getting swollen glands.
	Amy	[extendedly] Ew!
	Hermes	[extendedly] Oh!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[extendedly, off camera] Oh!
	Leela	Screw the quarantine! I'm outta here!
	Female CDC scientist	Initiate containment procedure.
	Leela	Ah! [The male CDC scientist hits Leela again.] Ow! [The male CDC scientist hits Leela again.] Oh!
	Male CDC scientist	G'wan now.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now I'm sick! [Leela stops walking backwards. Professor Farnsworth turns to Fry.] I shudder to think what this cold will do to me. Yesterday, I was nearly killed by a tight hat!
	Bender	I'd be remiss if I didn't rub your goopy noses in the fact that I'm immune.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Which is why we'll all be counting on you and you alone to nurse us through this catastrophe.
	Bender	Why, God? [Bender raises both his hands.] Why 'ave I been singled out?
	Fry	Everyone just calm down and make yourself a tissue walrus.
	Yancy Fry Sr	[off camera] Damn it, son. [Mrs. Fry and Yancy Fry Sr are sitting at the table as well.] [on camera] Lose the tissues. You're ruinin' Thanksgivin' dinner.
	Fry	I'm busy with my space experiment. I can't devote precious brainpower to blowing my nose.
	Yancy Fry Sr	You're never gonna win that science fair, Philip. Face it: [Yancy Fry Sr points at Fry with his left hand.] Someone with your limited brainpower'd be lucky to get a job as a pizza delivery boy.
	Mr. Panucci	Hey, Barack! [Mr. Panucci puts the pizza box on the counter.] Pizza goin' out. [Mr. Panucci raises his hands.] Come on!
	Barack Obama	Man, I've got to go back to law school.
	Fry	Pfff! [Fry turns to Yancy Fry Jr. Barack Obama leaves.] I'm not gonna wind up a loser like that guy.
	Yancy Fry Jr	Sure you will. [Fry turns to Yancy Fry Jr.] You're gonna lose the science fair. [Yancy Fry Jr points forward with his right hand. Fry turns to his right.] And that's who's gonna beat ya. [A boy wearing glasses, a shirt, and trousers and holding a soda cup with his right hand is in front of the counter. Mr. Panucci walks in front of him.] [off camera] Josh Gedgie, boy scientist.
	Josh Gedgie	Pi over four radians of pizza, please.
	Mr. Panucci	What is that? About a slice?
	Josh Gedgie	More like exactly a slice.
	Fry	Game on, Gedgie.
	Yancy Fry Jr	[off camera] Ew!
	Yancy Fry Sr	I've 'ad worse. When I was shot down over Korea, I had to eat Kimchi. [slowly] He was out interpreter.
	Bender	[screaming] Coming!
	Bender	What now?
	Amy	Humidifier.
	Bender	Fine. [Bender's chest cabinet starts shaking and begins exuding steam. A red light appears. Leela grabs the bell with her right hand and rings it. Bender turns to his left and stops exuding steam. The red light disappears.] Yes?!
	Leela	Where's that chicken soup we asked for?
	Bender	Chicken. [Bender throws the chicken, puts his left hand in his chest cabinet, and pulls out a bottle.] Water. [Bender throws the bottle, puts his left hand in his chest cabinet, and pulls out a lighter.] Fire. [Bender throws the lighter. The chicken and the bottle are in front of Leela. The lighter falls on Leela's forehead.] [off camera] You take it from there.
	Hermes	This is torture. The fever. The chills. And the sweating! [Hermes turns to Amy's feet, points at them with both his hands, and pushes them against Zoidberg's face.] Amy's horrible sweating!
	Bender	[slowly] That's it. I'm leavin' while I still 'ave my dignity. [Bender removes the green substance from his face.] [back to normal] See you in the obituaries!
	Male CDC scientist	How's the... Uh... Containment holdin' up?
	Female CDC scientist	Without turning my head, I'd say one-hundred percent.
	Bender	Howdy, folks. And may I say, "Nice work keepin' those sickos penned up." Put 'er there. [Bender shakes one of the officers' hand with his right hand.] You too, buddy. [Bender shakes another of the officers' hand with his right hand.] An' you. [Bender shakes another of the officers' hand with his right hand.] An' you. [Bender shakes another of the officers' hand with his right hand.] An' you. [Bender shakes another of the officers' hand with his right hand.] An' especially you.
	Fifth CDC officer	That Robot was a heckuva nice feller.
	Fry	You'd better stay here during biology. [Fry puts the cage in an open locker.] Mrs. Jenkins dissects anything smaller than a fifth grader.
	Josh Gedgie	Well, if it isn't Grandmaster Phlegm. I heard you're enterin' the NASA science competition.
	Fry	Maybe I am... LL Fool J!
	Josh Gedgie	So what's your project? The effects of losing on idiots?
	Fry	[angry] No! [happy] I'm gonna infect my guinea pig with the common cold and launch it into space to see if it gets cured by cosmic rays!
	Josh Gedgie	Lame! Though the common-cold virus does seem like a judge pleaser. [Josh Gedgie strokes his chin and looks around.] I think I'll steal that an' do an experiment that's slightly less... Very stupid!
	Fry	But that's my idea! You are an evil, evil nerd!
	Josh Gedgie	Gedgie out!
	Fry	We'll show him who's stupid.
	Morbo	Linda?
	Linda	Morbo. The so-called common cold, introduced by living fossil Philip J. Fry, is spreading out of control. [Morbo grabs a tissue with his left hand, blows his nose in it, and cleans his nose with it.] All citizens are advised to wash their hands thoroughly after beating up Philip J. Fry.
	Fry	Phew! [Fry turns to the others.] Lucky I'm safely locked up here with you guys.
	Amy	There 'e is!
	Hermes	Get him!
	Fry	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! What are you—
	Morbo	[on television] The situation is expected to deteriorate as newscasters whip the city into a panic.
	Morbo	Run! Run for your lives!
	Linda	And, finally, the heart-warming story of a handicapped magician who didn't know when to give up.
	Zapp	I don't like the looks of this, Mr. President. [Zapp turns to Richard Nixon's head.] Shall I switch it off?
	Richard Nixon	Negative. [Richard Nixon's head presses a button on his desk with his Robotic right hand. We hear a beep.] Rosemary, release the Surgeon General!
	Woman	[off camera] Get in there!
	Wernstrom	Ow! [Wernstrom closes his eyes and puts both his hands in front of his face.] It's bright out here.
	Richard Nixon	Wernstrom... [Wernstrom opens his eyes and puts both his hands down.] The quarantine 'as failed. Give me a worst-case scenario. And make it grim.
	Wernstrom	I've prepared some projections. [The red dot on Manhattan has disappeared. Wernstrom lifts up a remote control with two buttons on it with his right hand and presses one of the buttons. Zapp, Wernstrom, and Richard Nixon's head are looking at the screen. Wernstrom presses the button again. Another red dot appears on Manhattan.] Should the virus escape Manhattan, this is how far it will spread in twelve hours. [Wernstrom turns to his right and presses the button again. More red appears on the map. Wernstrom turns to his left and presses the button again. More red appears on the map.] This is twenty-four hours. [Wernstrom presses the button again. More red appears on the map.] This is a Verizon coverage map. [Wernstrom presses the button again. A rotating red globe appears on the screen.] And, in thirty-six hours, it will have infected the entire planet!
	Richard Nixon	Options?
	Zapp	We 'ave only one option. [Wernstrom turns to Zapp.] Protocol sixty-two.
	Richard Nixon	Not possible. We don't 'ave nearly enough piranhas!
	Zapp	Then protocol sixty-three it is.
	Hermes	Hooray! [Hermes puts his arms down, coughs, and raises his arms again.] They're letting us out!
	Zoidberg	And hundreds of black hovercopters are coming to welcome us!
	Hermes	They shrink-wrapped the hole city! Well, it could be worse. [Hermes shrugs. We see laser rays.] It is worse!
	Zoidberg	They're flying Manhattan into the Sun! [Zoidberg turns to Fry and points at the Sun with his left claw.] They must've been outta piranhas.
	Hermes	They're gonna kill the virus by exposing it to the heat of our burning bodies!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm just glad I have my wool scarf.
	Fry	What good is a wool—
	Bender	Guys! Guys! You're never gonna believe this!
	Amy	We know! They shmooped up Manhattan and blasted us toward the Sun!
	Bender	They did? Aw! [Bender opens his chest cabinet with his right hand, pulls out a box with SAVE OUR CHILDREN'S MUSEUM! on it and eleven coins in it with his left hand, and shakes the box.] So that's why this was unguarded.
	Wernstrom	People of New New York, this is Surgeon General Ogden Vernstrom.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wern-[violent coughing and sneezing]-strom!
	Wernstrom	No doctor likes hurling his patients into the Sun, but, since there is no way to make a vaccine for the common cold—
	Prof. Farnsworth	There is a way to make a vaccine!
	Fry	There is? [Fry raises his arms.] [extendedly] Yay!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Of course, there's a catch.
	Fry	[extendedly] Woo!
	Fry	[continued] Woo! [extendedly] Yay! Yay! [Fry turns to Professor Farnsworth.] So what's the catch?
	Prof. Farnsworth	The vaccine requires the original, unmutated, 20th-century cold virus. So I need to grind you into a paste.
	Leela	Professor, no!
	Fry	It's okay, Leela. This is all my fault, sort of. If this will save you, then, please, turn me into a virus milkshake.
	Prof. Farnsworth	He consented! [Professor Farnsworth grabs the lever.] You all heard it!
	Yancy Fry Sr	Yes, sir. Many of these entries merit a ride in the mighty bosom of our space shuttle. [Yancy Fry Sr crosses his arms.] And then there's your so-called entry.
	Fry	Jeez! [Josh Gedgie opens his eyes.] Walk much, Gedgie?!
	Josh Gedgie	Absurd. You really think your guinea pig could survive in the vacuum of space?
	Fry	He already survived in the vacuum of my mom. [Fry shrugs.] I mean, "My mom's vacuum."
	Josh Gedgie	My experiment measures the effects of microgravity of the propagation of the common cold virus in an anaerobic environment; i.e., space. [Josh Gedgie puts the suitcase on a table and opens it; revealing a sign, seven test tubes, three petri dishes, and more objects; and puts the sign on the table. The sign reads, JOSH GEDGIE - The effects of microgravity on the propagation of the common cold virus in an anaerobic environment. Josh Gedgie turns to his right and crosses his arms.] Impressed?
	Yancy Fry Sr	Damn right I am. [Yancy Fry Sr walks up to Josh Gedgie.] That's some dry, emotionless science. [Yancy Fry Sr pats Josh Gedgie on Josh Gedgie's left arm three times.] Nice job, son.
	Fry	Hey, wait a second! [Fry looks at Professor Farnsworth.] I know where you can get some 20th-century cold virus without killing me!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hush, lad. [Professor Farnsworth raises his right hand.] I'm totally in the zone.
	Fry	We just 'ave to find the Nerd Search '88 satellite!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[sad] I don't know why I even build these things.
	Leela	Gunnery Chief Bender, blast us out of quarantine.
	Bender	Aye, aye, lady.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, fiddlepoop! Our weapons aren't strong enough to puncture a thin plastic tent that thick?!
	Leela	No. But theirs are!
	Kif	Captain, a ship is attempting to break the quarantine.
	Zapp	Blow them to baco bits with a well placed warning shot!
	Kif	But—
	Zapp	Oops.
	Fry	We'll find that cold virus. [Fry raises his left fist.] The Nerd Search satellite was launched on the space shuttle and released into orbit.
	Leela	Hmmm. All ancient satellites were swept up as space junk in 2113. [Leela looks at Fry and removes her right hand from the device as she turns to him.] I actually knew that offhand. [Leela puts her right hand back on the device as she turns to it.] I'm Facebooking right now.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Aha! [Professor Farnsworth turns his chair towards Leela and Fry.] That satellite was scuttled on Enceladus, Saturn's main dump moon!
	Fry	Let's dump it up!
	Leela	This is the exact location of the dump. [Leela turns to her left.] But there's nothing here.
	Bender	Can we please go home an' die now?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm with Bender. [Fry turns to Professor Farnsworth.] Whatever was here's been covered by centuries of ice buildup.
	Fry	No! [Fry walks forward.] It's under here somewhere. We just 'ave to bust our way down. [Fry raises both his fists.] Remember the code of the ice. Thin an' crispy, way too risky.
	Leela	[screaming, off camera] I found a satellite!
	Fry	Let's just hope the experiment's still in here. [Fry opens the frozen satellite with his left hand.] Yes! We're saved!
	Ben Beeler	And now, to present the awards, our very special guest. [The man straightens his tie.] He walked on the Moon and now he is judging a high-school science contest. [The man points up with his left hand.] Truly a man who can and will do anything... Dr. Buzz Aldrin!
	Buzz Aldrin	Wow! [The audience stops applauding as well. Buzz Aldrin points at the man with his right hand.] I could've used an introduction like that when I first met the Moon men! [Buzz Aldrin laughs. The audience does the same.] But, seriously, there are Moon men. [The man approaches the podium and points at the watch on his left arm with his right hand and clears his throat. Buzz Aldrin turns to the man and then to the crowd.] Okay. This year's Nerd Search runner-up is a young man who devised a way to add and subtract in zero gravity. [Buzz Aldrin raises his left hand.] Vijay Patel and his calculator space hat!
	Vijai Patel	[extendedly] Woo! [Vijai Patel walks up to the stage, shakes Buzz Aldrin's hand, grabs a piece of rolled paper, and turns to the crowd.] Woo!
	Buzz Aldrin	And now the grand-prize winner whose experiment will be launched into space.
	Yancy Fry Sr	[off camera] Look at that cocky smirk. [The camera zooms out, revealing Yancy Fry Sr. Yancy Fry Sr turns to Fry and puts his left hand on Fry's right shoulder. Fry turns to Yancy Fry Sr. Yancy Fry Sr turns forward. Josh Gedgie turns forward. Yancy Fry Sr removes his left hand from Fry's right shoulder.] [on camera] My money's on Gedgie.
	Fry	Yeah? He may 'ave brains, but I 'ave heart.
	Buzz Aldrin	Josh Gedgie!
	Yancy Fry Sr	I'll bring the car around.
	Prof. Farnsworth	What a well prepared virus culture. [Professor Farnsworth lifts up the petri dish.] This will make a fine vaccine.
	Fry	Good thing Gedgie won. My dumb experiment wouldn't've lasted an hour in space, let alone a thousand years. Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my guinea pig in the parking lot.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Eh, okay. Uh, come on, gang. Let's go inoculate everyone and cram Manhattan back into its rightful hole!
	Prof. Farnsworth	This may hurt a little.
	Wernstrom	Ow!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now, I'll give you the shot.
	Leela	You saved millions of lives, Fry. You should feel proud. No matter what your dad said to you.
	Yancy Fry Sr	You still 'aven't thanked me for pullin' you outta the lake, soldier.
	Fry	I could've flip-flopped out.
	Yancy Fry Sr	I know that. [Yancy Fry Sr grabs a can labelled LÖBRAU BEER with his right hand and opens it.] Look, son. [Fry is looking forward.] I know I give you the business sometimes. [Fry looks at Yancy Fry Sr.] But, if I'm hard on you, it's only 'cause I want you to grow up strong and resilient. [Yancy Fry Sr looks at Fry and then up.] Someday, you may face adversities so preposterous, I can't even conceive of them. [Yancy Fry Sr shrugs and looks at Fry.] But I know you'll pull through and make me proud. [Yancy Fry Sr puts his left hand on Fry's left shoulder.] I love you, son.
	Yancy Fry Sr	[off camera] Now, bundle up. [The camera finishes zooming out.] I don't want you gettin' frozen.
