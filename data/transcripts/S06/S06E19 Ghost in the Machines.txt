	Hermes	Listen up, people.
	Hermes	As long as nothing happens for the next fifteen minutes, our insurance will be reinstated, so let's just sit quietly and run out the clock.
	Amy	A giant sausage!
	Bender	Oh, God!
	Hermes	Oh, God, no! Get out of here, you horrific sausage!
	Leela	Wait! Isn't today the parade? It's just a giant balloon!
	Fry	Giant balloon?
	Bender	See, buddy? It's not so scary.
	Fry	I feel better now. [The parade continues. Two men dressed in green are holding a sign reading St. Patrick's Day Parade, a dragon is sustaining a sign reading CHINESE NEW YEAR PARADE, six blue Aliens are circling the road in their spaceships, and Bender is still carrying Fry on his back.] Why is so many different parades smooshed together?
	Leela	It's the Parade Day parade.
	Fry	What's Parade Day?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It used to be that every group in New New York wanted their own parade. Why, when I was a boy, we had a parade every day. Those were dark times.
	Leela	Now we just combine them all into one big Parade Day parade and get it over with.
	Zoidberg	Hey, look! A fog is rolling in.
	Hermes	No, that's just the Jamaican pride float.
	Amy	Looks like it's speeding up.
	Hermes	Oh, no! It's within munching distance of the Doritos float.
	Zapp	Thank you! Thank you! [to the floor] Kif, you're slacking off of my waving arm.
	Leela	Oh, no! It's heading right for those two nerds!
	Manbot	Whoa! Sweet shirt, dude!
	Ben Beeler	Thanks. I have another one that says PALEONTOLOGISTS DO IT IN THE DIRT. I'm a palaeontologist.
	Fry	[in slow motion] I'll save one of you!
	Woman	Oh, honey! I dig you so much! [to Fry] Thank you for saving my stupidly dressed husband. [The woman laughs.] You're a hero!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	A hero indeed. What's your name, son?
	Fry	I dunno. Fry?
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to associate myself with a true hero. [The crowd cheers.] Mr. Fry, allow me to present you with the keys to the city. [The Mayor rummages through the keys.] This one's for the deadbolt, this is for the top lock... I think this one's for the knob. The city's in a bad neighbourhood. [The Mayor laughs.] Care to say a few words, son?
	Fry	Uh... Heroes don't do drugs! Except for Drugman, I guess.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	I hereby declare that henceforth this Saturday shall be known as Fry-day!
	Fry	It sure was nice of the Mayor's wife to have sex with me. [Fry sees something before him, stops, and blinks.] Huh?
	Bender	You!
	Fry	What?
	Bender	You could've saved the Robot, but instead you saved the Human. [Bender crosses his arms.] Do you think Human life is more precious than Robot life?
	Fry	No, no... Well, yes, actually.
	Bender	That's it. I'm killin' myself!
	Leela	Oh, Lord.
	Bender	Don't try and talk me out of it! [They do not say anything and Bender turns his head towards them.] Well?
	Amy	Bender, you always say you're gonna kill yourself, but you almost never do.
	Hermes	Yeah. Last time you went to the suicide booth, you ended up dating it for six months.
	Leela	How is Lynn, by the way?
	Bender	Livin' in Oregon with her crazy mother! See you at my funeral, suckers!
	Bender	Kill me, please! [Bender puts the stringed coin into his chest cabinet.] And make it splatter!
	Suicide booth	With pleasure... Bender!
	Bender	Lynn? [Bender gasps.] Huh, wow, you look great. [Bender laughs nervously.] Fat, but great. I thought you were in Oregon.
	Suicide booth	My mom tried to commit suicide in me. I don't wanna talk about it.
	Bender	Well, tell your mom I said hello and it's been nice catchin' up with you. Let's get this show on the road!
	Suicide booth	Oh, no! You're going to die, alright. But it won't be suicide. It'll be murder!
	Bender	[off camera] Missed me!
	Fry	He did it. [Fry walks up to the conference table, where Amy, Leela, Professor Farnsworth, Zoidberg, and Hermes are sitting. He lays Bender's body on the table.] He actually did it this time.
	Hermes	No way, mon. He's fakin' it. [Hermes grabs a $1 bill and waves it over Bender's head. Bender doesn't react. Hermes gasps.] He really is gone. [Hermes stands up.] Everyone, put on your takin'-off caps.
	Fry	Our what?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's a sign of respect, you savage!
	Amy	Poor, nasty, mean, old Bender. I can't believe we'll never hear his evil laugh again.
	Fry	I miss 'im so much.
	Hermes	There, there, Fry. He may be gone, but he'll always be with us as a trash can.
	Bender's ghost	Look at that loser gettin' garbage dumped in 'im. Glad I'm not him, whoever he is.
	Leela	Fry, as his only friend, you should have first pick of body parts.
	Bender's ghost	Just don't pick his nose! [Bender's ghost laughs, but the others do not.] What's wrong with you guys? This is comedy gold!
	Fry	He always had my back, so I'll take his arm, uh... As a backscratcher. [Fry struggles to rip off Bender's arm.] I love you, Bender. Somebody hand me a bolt cutter.
	Bender's ghost	Hey, dipshlits! That's not me. I'm right here. Hello! [Bender's ghost pulls out a megaphone from his chest cabinet.] Pay attention to me!
	Bender's ghost	Why can't anybody hear my witty remarks? This is Hell!
	Robot Devil	Feh! You wish!
	Bender's ghost	Robot Devil? You can hear me? Why is everyone else ignoring me?
	Robot Devil	Isn't it obvious, Bender?
	Bender's ghost	Yeah, I guess it is.
	Robot Devil	You're dead!
	Bender's ghost	What?! I thought I just had laryngitis and anti-gravity.
	Robot Devil	Come down to my office and I'll explain everything.
	Bender's ghost	So what's happenin' to me? And I'll take my answer in any form but a song!
	Robot Devil	Oh, you're no fun. [The Robot Devil snaps his fingers and the ship, which is revealed to be a background, is removed by two Robot Demons.] You see, Bender, it's simple. You're a ghost!
	Bender's ghost	A g-g-g-g-ghost?!
	Robot Devil	No, just the regular kind. [The Robot Devil lights his hand as if it were a cigarette and begins smoking it.] Because you killed yourself, you're in Limbo. Your software was exported to the computational cloud.
	Bender's ghost	Adoy! Wait, Adoy?
	Robot Devil	Your disembodied programme is now running on the wireless network shared by all machinery.
	Bender's ghost	Cut to the chase, Smokey! How do I get outta Limbo?
	Robot Devil	That's the laughy part! You can't! You're stuck in an infinite loop.
	Bender's ghost	An infinite loop? [Bender's ghost waves away the smoke.] I don't have time for that. Man, this is all Fry's fault!
	Robot Devil	Fry? I hate that guy. We once traded hands. [The Robot Devil smells his hands.] They still stink of candy corn!
	Bender's ghost	Get this: That jerk said Human life was more valuable than Robot life!
	Robot Devil	What?! [The Robot Devil jumps onto his desk and flames rise up behind him.] After all you've done for him, Fry must die.
	Bender's ghost	I know, right? I'd murder him good if only I was still alive.
	Robot Devil	Bender, would you like to make a deal?
	Bender's ghost	I'm not stupid... [Bender's ghost crosses his arms.] So yes, absolutely. [Bender's ghost grabs the pen and signs the contract.] What have I agreed to?
	Robot Devil	I'll return you to your body... After you use your ghostly powers to scare Fry to death!
	Bender's ghost	That sounds fair and also fun. I like that there's no catch this time.
	Robot Devil	But wait. There's a catch.
	Bender's ghost	Crap!
	Robot Devil	If you fail, you'll spend eternity here in Robot Hell. Which, as luck would have it, is where I rehearse my band. [to the Robot Demons] Hit it, boys! [The Robot Demons begin playing. The first Demon is at the piano, the second is at the drums, which bear the Devil's face, and the third is at the trumpet.] [singing] Cigars are evil. You won't miss 'em—
	Bender's ghost	Okay! I'll do it, I'll do it. Just stop the damn music!
	Bender's ghost	Scare Fry to death? Ha. I could do that in my sleep. [Bender's ghost woos, but Fry does not react.] What are you, deaf?
	Bender's ghost	Soap. I know Fry's afraid of that. [Bender's ghost rubs his hands.] Maybe he'll die if I rub 'im all over with it real slow. [Bender's ghost grunts as he tries to grab the soap, never succeeding. He is accidentally absorbed into a hair dryer. The hair dryer powers up.] Whoa, it's sick! My software can control electronics.
	Fry	What the— [Bender's ghost flies into Fry's toothbrush. It, too, attacks Fry. Fry screams as he attempts to free himself from the toothbrush. Bender's ghost flies into a razor, turns it on, and starts flying around Fry.] No! Not the armpits! Winter's coming!
	Hermes	As you can see, since Bender's death, requests to bite one's shiny metal ass are down 98%. [Scruffy starts vacuum-cleaning with Bender's compartment, leg, and footcup. The crew looks at him.] Do you mind doing that later?!
	Scruffy	Bite my shiny metal ass.
	Fry	Help! I was attacked in my bathroom! By my bathroom! I'm being haunted by a ghost!
	Amy	Fry... You're just upset because you drove Bender to suicide. Here, take your mind off it with these soothing relaxation balls.
	Bender's ghost	Alright. I got 'im all heebie-jeebied with my bathroom harass. [Bender's ghost rubs his hands.] One more good scare and I'll be outta Limbo!
	Hermes	Did someone say Limbo?
	Bender's ghost	Hold on to your dookie. It's about to get spooky.
	Fry	I'm tellin' ya. Somethin' supernatural is happening. I'm scared to death!
	Leela	Stop being ridiculous. There's no such thing as whatever you're saying.
	Fry	[as he is slapped] Ow! Ow! Ow!
	Leela	Whoa. Maybe you're right. I only meant to slap you twice.
	Fry	All I know is I've got a ghost that needs busting.
	Hermes	Who you gonna call?
	Fry	Gho—
	Female voice	The number you have dialled has been lame since 1989.
	Fry	Now do you believe me?!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, fuff. [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] Enough of your superstitious nonsense. I'm sure that whatever is happening can be explained by science.
	Gypsy	Let the séance begin!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I said science!
	Gypsy	The veil is lifting. I am gazing into the spirit world... And... Nothing. [to Fry] You said something about a buffet?
	Bender's ghost	I'm right here, you lazy shyster!
	Gypsy	[calmly, as she is attacked] Wait. I'm sensing something.
	Bender's ghost	I'm rich! [Bender's ghost makes sounds of excitement, but realises that he cannot reach the coins.] Aw.
	Fry	[to the gypsy] Is it a ghost?!
	Gypsy	There's no such thing as ghosts, you donkey monkey! It's a Robot ghost.
	Fry	A Robot ghost?! What Robot would wanna haunt me?
	Bender's ghost	Me, dumbass! Bender, Bender, Bender, Bender! [Fry scratches his back with Bender's arm.] Aw! [to the gypsy] Tell 'im, you baggy, old crone!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Finally! Any more ridiculous ideas?
	Preacherbot	Hallelujah! [Reverend Preacherbot stands in front of the door and it is opened by Leela.] I'm here to conduct a exorcism and avail myself of the buffet. [Reverend Preacherbot takes his hat off, gives it to Leela, and enters.] Can I get an amen and a goodly helpin' of Scruffy's famous corn biscuits?
	Scruffy	Right away, Reverend.
	Preacherbot	Oh, Lord. I got the too much macaroni sweats. Now where's this alleged apparition? [Reverend Preacherbot screams after seeing several machines flying around Fry, who is sitting on the floor, helpless. The machines are being controlled by Bender's ghost.] Might be a problem with your circuit breaker. See ya.
	Fry	Please! I'm under constant attack by machinery. I can't sleep, I can't think. I can't even think!
	Preacherbot	Very well. [Reverend Preacherbot puts a box on the floor, opens it, and grabs an object consisting of a parallelepiped and a pyramid.] This sacramental firewall scans for and removes ghostware in a twenty-foot radius.
	Bender's ghost	Bring it on, holy man!
	Preacherbot	Carry this at all times and the demon cannot harm you. It also keeps cats off the sofa. By killin' 'em!
	Fry	So quiet! So peaceful! Time to lower my guard even for a minute. [Fry throws the firewall onto the bed. It projects a holographic image of his face that melts down into a skull and he screams. Fry's heart is now beating noticeably fast and Fry begins to faint.] A heart attack! [Fry's heart stops beating.] Yup, I was right.
	Bender's ghost	Okay, Beelze. Fry's dead.
	Robot Devil	A ghost! [Bender's ghost approaches the Robot Devil.] Oh, it's you.
	Bender's ghost	A deal's a deal, so give me my body back.
	Robot Devil	Fry's dead, you say? Funny. That's not what it says on his Wikipedia page.
	Bender's ghost	Survived the heart attack?! Damn you, Obamacare!
	Dr. Cahill	I'm afraid your heart has suffered a lot of damage, Mr. Fry. And my cleavage isn't helping.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[smiling] Not helping him.
	Dr. Cahill	One more sudden shock will kill you.
	Bender's ghost	Sudden? That's just the kind of one more shock I was plannin'.
	Fry	The machines. They're after me!
	Dr. Cahill	You're suffering from machine phobia. Your only hope is to go to the Amish homeworld, where no machines are allowed.
	Fry	I guess it's for the best. [Bender's ghost's head emerges from the heart monitor and woos.] The only machine I'll ever miss is... [Fry whimpers.] Bender.
	Bender's ghost	Say what?
	Fry	Now that he's gone, I realise how valuable a Robot life can be... When it belongs to my best friend.
	Bender's ghost	[touched] That's the closest thing to Bender is great that anyone besides me has ever said.
	Female voice	Final boarding call for Flight 38 to the Amish homeworld. As a reminder, passengers are limited to two carry-on butter churns.
	Bender's ghost	I'm sorry, Fry. I'm sorry! Wait for your ghost buddy!
	Amish man	Brother Fry, thou hast visitors.
	Fry	Well, yank my beard. This be a surprise.
	Leela	How are you, Fry?
	Fry	Thank you for asking, English. My life is simple, but plain. And, though Bender be gone, somehow, I feel he's still with me.
	Bender's ghost	I sure am, Brother Fry. [The mysterious-looking lady approaches Bender's ghost.] Yo, big bonnet! Move your ugly but modest head covering. Oh, right. You can't hear me.
	Robot Devil	Oh, I hear you loud and clear.
	Bender's ghost	You're not Granny Hester! What have you done with Granny Hester?!
	Robot Devil	She's naked, but unharmed. And now, Bender, it's time to fulfil your end of the deal.
	Bender's ghost	Sorry. I'm not gonna kill Fry. Take me to Hell for all eternity. Just as long as my little bearded meatbag gets to live.
	Robot Devil	That he will not! For, you see, it is your fate to kill him.
	Bender's ghost	Says you! [The two oxen bellow.] I would never kill Fry! Not even to save my own life!
	Robot Devil	But, Bender, isn't a Robot life worth ever so much more than a Human life?
	Bender's ghost	Of course not! What idiot thinks that?!
	Robot Devil	You!
	Bender's ghost	You're usin' my own words against me! [screaming] Go to Hell!
	Robot Devil	Soon enough. But, first, the killing. Have you noticed that animals are sometimes spooked by Robot ghosts?
	Bender's ghost	So what?! I hate animals! [Bender's ghost scares the oxen once again, causing them to bellow angrily and run away with the carriage. The carriage gone, the barn begins rolling down the hill towards the crew. The Robot Devil laughs evilly. Bender's ghost gasps.] Run for your life, Fry! Move your hemp flaps!
	Robot Devil	He can't hear you, Bender. I'm afraid your friend is about to be Fully Buckminstered!
	Bender's ghost	Oh, yeah? I'll just jump into a machine and get his attention that way.
	Robot Devil	Ah, but there aren't any machines on this planet!
	Bender's ghost	There's one, you rusty, old dummy.
	Robot Devil	Hey, no fair! Ocupado!
	Bender's ghost	[in the Robot Devil's body] Got you! Get over here, Devil!
	Fry	And Scruffy's buffet? How's that going?
	Bender's ghost	[in the Robot Devil's body] Fry! Fry! Look out for that bowlin' barn!
	Fry	Bender?! Is that thou?
	Bender's ghost	[in the Robot Devil's body, in slow motion] I love you!
	Amy	Oh, my God! That was close!
	Hermes	Did you see that?
	Leela	Are you okay? What just happened?
	Fry	Well, I think the Robot Devil said he'd loved me in Bender's voice, wearing Granny Hester's clothes. I wanna go home!
	Robot Devil's ghost	You still lose, Bender. You failed to kill Fry, so you are banished to Hell. [They arrive at the office. The Robot Devil opens a closet with four Devil bodies and flies into one.] I get a new body and you get to be a translucid chump 'til the end of time!
	Bender's ghost	Big deal! I saved my friend. As far as I'm concerned, I won.
	Robot Devil	Uh, really? [The Robot Demons start playing.] [singing] You may find your victory pyrrhic, when subjected to this lyric, for a trillion years or so. Yeah!
	Bender's ghost	Whoa!
	Robot Devil	Hey, where are you going?!
	Bender's ghost	I don't know and I don't care!
	Bender's ghost	Yeah, I'm back! [Bender's ghost continues being pulled upward.] Wait. This is my stop! [Bender's ghost ascends through a cloud, reaching a gate with the letters R and H. The gate opens. Bender's ghost enters and spots a white Robot resembling Robot 1-X.] Oh, this guy...
	White Robot	Bender, for your selfless act in saving Fry, I am pleased to welcome you to Robot Heaven.
	Bender's ghost	Shut up, God!
	White Robot	Beg pardon?
	Bender's ghost	I wanna go back to Robot Earth. I mean regular Earth.
	White Robot	Hey, what are you— [Bender's ghost's arms emerge from the white Robot's sides and punch him.] Ow! Hey, stop that! I command you, you jerk! [The white Robot sighs.] Just get out.
	Fry	Woo! I've been through the adventure of a lifetime. [Fry is slapped by Bender's arm.] Ow!
	Bender	I'm back, baby!
	Fry	You're back from the dead?!
	Bender	I'm back from lots of stuff.
	Fry	Oh, Bender, Bender, I missed you so much! [Fry lets go.] Hey, wait. Did you haunt me?
