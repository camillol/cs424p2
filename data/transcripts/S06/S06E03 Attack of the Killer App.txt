	Mayor Poopenmeyer	As mayor, it is my deeply tedious pleasure to kick off the 83rd or 84th Annual e-Waste Recycling Festival!
	Bender	Down in front!
	Zoidberg	Sorry, I get aroused in crowds.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	I will now throw out the ceremonial first dump: [takes an old machine that says Elect-O-Matic 2000 and is about to put it in the recycling bin] this old inefficient vote rigger! [throws it away as the crowd cheers and the fin grows back on Zoidberg's head]
	Leela	So long, overly complicated Japanese toilet!
	Toilet	[in a stereotypical Japanese accent] Please. I not to throw away. I give you, uh, Happy Poopie Time.
	Fry	Sorry, you know too much.
	Bender	Seems like a good place to ditch some evidence. [takes something out of his cavity, opens the bin and finds a familiar robot] Flexo?! What are you doin' in a hazardous wastebin?
	Flexo	Haven't you heard? Us bending units are dangerously outdated. We overheat, we're radioactive, we cause erectile dysfun—
	Prof. Farnsworth	Who were you talking to?
	Bender	[slides the evidence with his footcup under the bin] No one? Your mama? Shut up? Take your pick.
	Scoop Chang	Scoop Chang, New New York Times Online Podcast blog comments editor. Mr. Mayor, isn't this e-waste dangerous?
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Not at all, Scoop. Not after it's hauled off to the Third World by an expendable team of minimum-wage nobodies.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[whispering to the other three] Good news, nobodies!
	Antarian #1	Greetings, my friends. It shan't take long to strip down your clunker. [knocks the staircase twice]
	Leela	There's nothing wrong with our clunker.
	Antarian #1	Really? Because we can smelt out the deadly, deadly chromium to make rat poison and artificial sweeteners.
	Leela	No, thanks. We're delivering e-waste.
	Antarian #1	Pity. We're halfway done.
	Antarian #2	This thing is 40% chromium.
	Antarian #1	Gentle now. Gentle with the hover dumpster.
	Antarian #1	Ready for processing! [squirts the oil, takes out a match, lights it, and spreads it on the oil]
	Fry	[sniffs as his nose bleeds] What smells like bloody sinuses?
	Antarian #1	We burn your e-waste down to the usable metals, safely releasing the toxins into our air and drinking water.
	Leela	Uch! That's the worst thing I've ever seen!
	Antarian #1	Really? Then don't look over there. [points to a bunch of Antarian children playing in a pile of e-Waste, to the kids] Okay, kids, let's play Find the Shiny!
	Leela	That's even more horrific! Is all the work done by children?
	Antarian #1	No. Not the whipping.
	Phone	[like an old 1930's switchboard operator] Hello, Miss Turanga, your call to St. Louis has gone through.
	Bender	[grabbing the television] Well, let's at least throw this TV out. [rips it from the wall] The batteries in the remote are gettin' low.
	Leela	No! Put that back and turn it on!
	Bender	I was just tryin' to help. [puts the television back on the wall as Fry turns it on with the remote]
	Morbo	More on this breaking puff piece after a word from our sponsor.
	Announcer	WIth the new eyePhone, you can watch, listen, ignore your friends, stalk your ex, download porno on a crowded bus, even check your E-mail while getting hit by a train. All with the new eyePhone.
	Mom	From Mom.
	Leela	A new eyePhone? Forget this junk. [throws out her cell phone again]
	Phone	Well, this is a fine howdoyoudo.
	Hermes	[throws out his BlackBerry] So long.
	Fry	[throws out his phone] Sayonara.
	Amy	[throws out her miniature cell phone] Buh-bye.
	Zoidberg	[throws out his shell phone] Good riddance.
	Bender	[throws out his old wireless phone] Yep.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[throws out his even older wireless phone] Toodle-oo!
	Leela	Come on! Let's buy some eyePhones on line!
	Fry	Wait. I thought we were buying our eyePhones online.
	Leela	We are on line.
	Fry	But I thought the Mom Store was across town.
	Amy	It is across town.
	Bender	Stop thinking, Fry!
	Fry	I feel like a mindless zombie. I wish I knew how long we've been waiting.
	Ben Beeler	The eyePhone has an app for that!
	Bender	Is there an app for kissin' my shiny metal ass?
	Ben Beeler	Several!
	Bender	Ooooooh!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, no! The light! I guess I'm off to Hell.
	Hermes	That's the store, Professor.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Eh-wha?
	Amy	Shwow! It's that obscure underground song that's constantly playing everywhere.
	Mom	[in her sweet voice] Hello, dearies. Welcome to the Mom Store. The new eyePhones are in short supply, so please form an orderly—
	Bender	Outta the way!
	Fry	[panting] Are there any left?
	Salesman	There may be one.
	Salesman	Okay, it's $500, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold a charge and the reception isn't very—
	Fry	[taking out a wad of cash] Shut up and take my money!!
	Mom	The new eyePhone is wonderful. I use it to check recipes and send threatening e-mails to unauthorized third party app developers.
	Fry	Say, you're from one of those ethnicities that knows about technology. Why's it called an eyePhone?
	Salesman	I'll explain after I install it.
	Fry	Neat.
	Salesman	[putting an earpiece in Fry's left ear] Now for the earpiece. [lifts a huge mallet, but we don't see him hammer it in, instead, we pan back to the video screen]
	Mom	But my favorite app is called "Twitcher". [we hear the salesman hammer in the earpiece] Twitcher lets you send and receive short messages called "twits". [we hear a ding] Why, [blinks her eyes and activates a floating screen showing Larry] here's a twit now.
	Larry	Hi, Mom, I love you more than Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar—
	eyePhone	Low battery.
	Mom	But don't take my word for it. [a screen showing a web site appears, which Mom reads] Unbiasedreviews.mom says, "Twitcher is the Killer App!"
	Mom	[normal voice] And when I say, "killer app", I mean, "KILLER app!"
	Announcer	And now, another downloadisode of "The Real Housewives of Sim City"!
	Sims Woman	She needs to reset. I'll say it to her face.
	Fry	No wonder traditional media is dead! Check out this webisode of Hypnotoad.
	Bender	Enjoy your outdated format, Grandpa. [blinks his eyes to open an episode of All My Circuits] Nowadays, cool kids like me mash up our own phoneisodes.
	Calculon	It's from the kidnappers. My nephew is alive and he's...in this envelope.
	Calculon's Nephew	[looking flat] They cut off one of my dimensions!
	Calculon	[as Monique sobs] No. No!
	Bender	[on screen] Oh, my God! It's Bender! He'll save us!
	Fry	What's happening to me? Is it puberty?
	Bender	It's a phone call, dingus.
	Fry	These eyePhones are phones, too?
	Bender	Duh!
	Fry	Fry-lo.
	Leela	[on screen] Hi, Fry. Did you know these eyePhones are phones, too?
	Fry	Duh. Hey, is it safe to talk while you're flying?
	Leela	[on screen] Oh, totally. This thing's hands-free. [takes out a taco] That's how I can eat this taco [takes out a fork with spaghetti in another hand] and this spaghetti.
	Leela	I'm hanging up now. [Fry and Leela touch their noses and hang up]
	Bender	Hey, check out this Internet video of some idiot crashing her spaceship!
	Leela	You recorded that?
	Bender	The eyePhone records everything. All I did was add a laugh track and twit it to my 10,000 followers.
	Fry	Oh, that reminds me. It's time to twit my hourly twupdate. [Fry records a twit on his eyePhone] 'Sup, followers? Fry here. [belches] Burpin' eggs. [scratches his armpit] Scratchin' my underarm fungus. Lookin' for love. Send.
	Larry	Underarm fungus? [gasps] Too much informatio—[Mom slaps him] OW!
	Mom	It's exactly the right amount of information! For years, I've collected personal data with old-fashioned methods like spybots and infosquitoes.
	Infosquito	This guy sure loves porno.
	Mom	But now, thanks to Twitcher, morons voluntarily spew out every fact I need to exploit them.
	Walt	Target acquired, Mother.
	Mom	Fire direct marketing algorithm!
	Man	Do you suffer from the heartbreak of...?
	Fry's Voice	"—my underarm fungus."
	Man	Then, you, Mr. or Mrs. ... [we hear a soundbite of Fry belching], need the soothing relief of Mom's Caustic Anti-Fungal Bleach!
	Fry	Ooh, can I somehow charge it to my eyePhone for an additional fee?
	Man	Hell, yes!
	Ad	Hey, fatso, stuffa you face!
	Hermes	[gasps] This thing always seems to know when I get the munchies! [closes Space Invaders and opens Twitcher] Attention followers: It's Free Topping Day at the pizza place across the street! Send.
	Leela	[twitting] Duh. That's why we all came over here for lunch. Send.
	Bender	[twitting] Greetings, followers: This is Day Five of my solo kayak journey around the world. Send. [laughs to himself, to Hermes] Can you believe 50,000 idiots swallow that crap? Send. Oops.
	Fry	[twitting to Bender] You have 50,000 followers? I only have three. Send.
	Leela	I unsubscribed yesterday.
	Bender	I got the most followers cuz I give the people what they want, like this video of you doin' karate in your underpants.
	Fry	[on screen] Help! Police!
	Bender	Send.
	Fry	That is low, Bender. Even by your standards.
	Bender	My what, now?
	Fry	Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?
	Bender	August 6, 1991.
	Fry	I'll bet I can get as many followers as you without sinking to your level. What do you say? First one to a million followers wins a buck.
	Bender	[stands up to shake Fry's hand] You're on! [ends up shocking Fry] Send.
	Fry	What happens to the loser?
	Bender	Let's make it interesting.
	Amy	Splech! Why is Mr. Chunks doing that?
	Bender	Because the loser of our bet has to do a double somersault into a tub of alien goat vomit. [giggles]
	Fry	Wait! Let's make it interestinger! [the camera cuts to reveal that the goat has two heads as Fry turns it around] Vomit and diarrhea!
	Bender	Good idea! That way, we don't waste an end!
	Leela	[brushing away the smell] Eg, it's putrid! What do you feed him?
	Bender	What comes out one end we feed to the other. Also Indian food. Let the contest begin!
	Igner	Why are you so angry, Mommy?
	Mom	Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just a little nervous about my evil plan. YOU DUMB BASTARDS!!! [she triple slaps all three of her sons] You see, the plan is about to enter phase two. As soon as someone reaches a million followers, I'll use them to transmit...the Twitworm!
	Walt	Oh, Mother, you devious hag, tell us more about this "Twitworm".
	Mom	It's a very special computer virus, for instead of infecting computers, it infects...the human brain!
	Infosquito	I like it!
	Mom	The million followers will become an army of zombies eager to obey my every command! [laughs evilly]
	Larry	The important thing is we're a family.
	Mom	NO IT'S NOT!
	Amy	Ew! He sneezed in it!
	Fry	Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the bet! I'm gonna have to swim in the juice of the puke-me-poop-yu!
	Amy	Don't give up. You just need more titillating twits.
	Fry	Trust me, I want twits that tittle.
	Leela	Then you're gonna have to sink to Bender's level. Stop acting like the Queen of England.
	Female Voice	[singing] La la la la la la la!
	Fry	Whose that? The Queen of England?
	Leela	[gets out of her lounge chair] Uh, e-e-excuse me. I have to...someplace. [takes her towel and exits]
	Fry	That was odd. Where'd that singing come from?
	Amy	It wasn't the goat. All of its orifices are in use.
	Female Voice	[singing in a Scottish accent] I dreamed a dream in time gone by...
	Leela;Female Voice	[singing] When hope was high and life worth living.I dreamed that love would never die.
	Susan	[still singing] I dreamed that God would be forgiving.
	Fry	What the hell is that?
	Leela	[hides the boil with a towel] Nothing.
	Susan	I'm not nothing! All my life, everyone's called me, "nothing"!
	Fry	You have a boil on your butt that sings showtunes with you?
	Leela	Don't look at me! I'm a freak!
	Fry	No, no. [shrugs] Well...
	Leela	[sighs] I've been ashamed of Susan as long as I can remember.
	Fry	You named your boil Susan?
	Susan	A boil cannae have a name. He also said a boil cannae sing. But... [sings] Amazing grace, how— [Leela pops Susan with a knife as she deflates and disappears]
	Fry	Ew, she's Scottish!
	Leela	[puts a bandage on the spot where the boil was] I lance her every few months, but she always grows back. [sobs] It's hard enough being a cyclops, but if anyone found out about Susan, I'd be devastated.
	Susan	[singing on Fry's eyePhone] Amazing grace, how— [she screams when she gets popped]
	Fry	Woah, gross. [gets inspired] A million follower gross.
	Leela	Fry, delete that! Delete that right now!
	Fry	What? Oh. Okay.
	Bender	[giggling and taking hot sauce out of his cavity and pouring it into the vomit] So much for a pleasant swim in vomit.
	Fry	[fake coughing and whispering] Send [fake coughing again]
	Leela	Did you delete it?
	Fry	[in horror] Eh.
	Leela	Thanks, Fry. [sniffles] You're a good friend.
	Fry	Ih.
	Susan	[on screen singing] Amazing grace, how— [screams]
	Sal	Whoa-whoa-whoas! If it ain'ts the world's number ones internet sensation!
	Leela	Where? Also, what?
	Susan	[singing] Ama-
	Susan	[singing] -zing grace, how [screams]
	Hermes	Play it one more time!
	Prof. Farnsworth	No! It's humiliating and degrading to Leela! Play it ten more times!
	Fry	[sighs] I know I shouldn't have twitted that but [he looks at the Twit Meter, which now has Bender at 934,802 followers and Fry just growing and growing inching closer to the same number of followers as Bender] not swimming in barf might ease my conscience.
	Zoidberg	But if Leela should find out, her dignity sac will rupture.
	Fry	That's why we can't let her see this. Leela, lock the doors so Leela doesn't—EEEEE!
	Leela	[sobbing] How could you do this?!!
	Amy	Poor Mr. Chunks. At least he died doing what he loved.
	Bender	He's in a better place now.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Impending news, everyone! We're about to learn the winner of the bet!
	Bender	Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! [whispers to Amy] I hope it's me!
	Hermes	Sweet Georgia Brown of Kingston Town! It's a tie! Since no one lost, no one has to jump!
	Bender	Alright, a tie! I win again!! [points to Fry as if to say, "In your face!"]
	Fry	Oh, I'm a scuzzball.
	Zoidberg	Don't feel bad. At least you're not Leela.
	Mom	A tie? This worked out better than I could have hoped! Now I'll have two million zombies!
	Walt	Actually, Fry and Bender may share some of the same followers. All we can say for sure is that there will be between one million and two million zombies.
	Mom	All I can say for sure is... [slaps Walt] Now stop getting slapped and power up the Twitworm!
	Hoschel	It's both disgusting and inspiring, like Jared from Subway.
	Leela	Okay, I'm a freak with a singing butt boil, but I'm still a human being more or less.
	Sal	Singin' butts boil? That's yesterday'ses news.
	Hoschel	Like that giant caterpillar what ate Jared from Subway.
	Sal	Nows us internet geeks gots a whole new video sensation.
	Leela	So my humiliation is over?
	Sal	Who are you?
	Mom	And now, to create an unstoppable army of between one and two million zombies!
	Igner	Uh, shouldn't you wait for the weather to clear up?
	Mom	No! I give you...the Twitworm! [pulls up a huge switch on the machine] Send.
	Fry	Aaah! I'm sick of my head doing things! [Leela comes up to him] Leela!
	Leela	Fry, I came to talk to you.
	Fry	No, I came to talk to you.
	Leela	It looked like you were just sitting there, but whatever.
	Fry	I am so, so sorry for what I did. And I know I can never make it up to you.
	Leela	You don't have to apologize. In fact, I came to thank you.
	Fry	I think you mean hit me.
	Leela	Everyone knows my secret, but no one cares. I have nothing to hide anymore. Oh, Fry, thanks to your selfish rudeness, a terrible weight has been lifted from my heart!
	Susan	That's not the only place you need a terrible weight lifted!
	Leela	Susan and I are agreed. For the first time in our lives, we're not ashamed of who were are.
	Susan	I was never ashamed.
	Leela	Come here. [she hugs Fry but then smells something] What stinks? Were you rolling around in New Jersey?
	Fry	Leela, I knew I could never make it up to you, so I did the next best thing. I put myself through the same humiliation I put you through.
	Leela	Aw, you didn't have to do that.
	Fry	I didn't? Damn.
	Leela	Don't worry. By tomorrow, no one will remember.
	Fry	Can I have another hug?
	Leela	No.
	Susan	Oh, hold yer nose an' give it a go!
	Mom	Introducing the all new eyePhone 2.0!
	Mom	Dumb bastards.
