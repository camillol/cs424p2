	Leela	Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
	Fry	I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. "Here's you pizza," I'd say. "I didn't order any," they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure.
	Leela	That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. [He hands them to her and she snaps it in half and looks through it like a telescope. Across the street an alien opens up Family Bros. Pizza.] I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
	Professor Farnsworth	Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
	Leela	Professor, please! Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
	Professor Farnsworth	No!
	Blek	You sure about these chairs? Guidebook says human legs bend down at knee.
	Blek	It's OK, Mama. Anyone complains, I bend legs up for free. [He sees Fry, Bender and Leela through the window.] Ooh! Customers! [Enter the trio.] Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit. I bend knees for you.
	Bender	Ooh! That's a-comfy!
	Blek	OK, now, what kind of pizza goes in you? [He points to a topping menu that offers silt, asbestos, flaming magnesium, stucco, scarab and guano.] Silt? Asbestos? We got guano -- very fresh!
	Fry	Uh ... hmm ... do you have any food?
	Blek	Here, try a deep dish pizza. [He puts a pizza topped with slop on the table.] Contains four kind of things.
	Leela	I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit.
	Cygnoid Woman	[happy] Thank you.
	Leela	No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.
	Fry	Hey, hey. What's wrong? Was it something Leela said?
	Cygnoid Woman	[crying] We come to Earth to start new life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, live Earthican dream.
	Fry	Aw. Don't cry, foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza, Earth style!
	Cygnoid Woman	Oh, thank you, magic biped!
	Blek	You save us, a-sir. If we cannot make Earth pizza our dream will die. Just like rats we crushed to make the wine.
	Fry	For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees. [He holds up a jar of live bees.] Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them.
	Cygnoid #2	Hey, ocupado!
	Fry	Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other. [He turns the TV on and there is a blernsball game on.] Ah, the Earthican pastime: Blernsball!
	Uecker	[on TV] Mulligan drives the ball. It's going, going and caught by the shortstop. Mets lose again. Man, I haven't seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker! This is Bob Uecker saying thanks for watching!
	Blek	Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter? I don't understand this "blernsball".
	Fry	Well, if you're going to be Earthicans, we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh, but you'll need nine players.
	Cygnoid Woman	No problem!
	Cygnoid #2	Play the ball!
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] Go, team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!
	Blek	Ah, this is why I love Earth! Beautiful star-brightened day, friendly blernsball game with chum pals! So pleasant for everybody.
	Scruffy	Hit by a pitch. Take your base.
	Leela	[shouting] Sorry about that. I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
	Bender	No batter! No batter! [Leela pitches and knocks the second Cygnoid over.] No batter anymore.
	Scruffy	Take your base.
	Leela	[shouting] I didn't mean to hit you. I have some trouble with depth perception.
	Cygnoid #2	Yeah, me too now.
	Bender	Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter! [The ball hits the Cygnoid.] Duck!
	Scruffy	Take your base.
	Cygnoid #3	Please, lady, I want to live. Can I use bat to protect head?
	Bender	Apparently not.
	Man	Check out the one-eyed bean machine!
	Blek	Hooray! I make a score point!
	Fry	Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch.
	Leela	But I've got a no-hitter going. [She sighs.] You're right. Here.
	Randy Munchnik	Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!
	Doubledeal	Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you.
	Leela	Am I under arrest?
	Bender	Wait! I know you. You're the sleazebag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
	Doubledeal	Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets.
	Leela	The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
	Doubledeal	Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna sign you to the team.
	Leela	You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball?
	Commissioner	Well, yeah, but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figure a one-eyed lady skull-buster might bring out the freakshow crowd.
	Leela	Wow! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball.
	Commissioner	Again, yeah, but basically you'd just be--
	Leela	Ta-da! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball. How do I look?
	Hermes	Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
	Professor Farnsworth	Why is your number seven-eighth's?
	Leela	All the whole numbers have been retired.
	Fry	Wow! I must say, I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?
	Leela	Fry, I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
	Fry	Oh! Now I'm too nervous.
	Uecker	Well, folks, it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned this one into a "laffer". And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of the stadium L.A.-style.
	Doubledeal	Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act: Leela.
	Skipper	Darn it! I already put in the circus clown.
	Doubledeal	Yeah, but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away.
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] Your attention, please. Now pitching for the Mets: Turanga Leela. [Leela walks out onto the pitch but the crowd doesn't notice.] A one-eyed woman.
	Woman	Come on! Throw like a girl!
	Fry	[shouting] Go, Leela!
	Bender	[shouting] Come on, girl!
	Amy	[shouting] Too much eyeliner!
	Uecker	This is history in the making, folks. Bjornson steps up to the plate and Leela delivers.
	Bender	Bullseye!
	Uecker	Ooh! An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer. [Another batter steps up and Leela beans him. The crowd gasps again.] An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer.
	Crowd	[chanting] Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!
	Uecker	Ouch! It's a three-bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though, and who can blame them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year--
	Doubledeal	Kid, that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. Poor Tex, he was quite a shark.
	Man #1	Hey!
	Man #2	Hey!
	Man #3	Come on!
	Man #4	I win!
	Bender	Oop! Sorry.
	Leela	Bender, how did you get in here?
	Bender	[taking off his shades] As your agent, I have access to you at all times.
	Leela	Since when are you my agent?
	Bender	Quiet, call coming in. [He clicks his headset.] Yes? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
	Leela	Bender, that's great! How much did you get me?
	Bender	[impressed] One hundred dollars.
	Leela	[reading] As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean balls. So I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans: They're the beaniest!
	Director #1	Cut!
	Uecker	In very short order, Leela has become a fan favourite.
	Bender	You're the best, babe! [His phone rings.] Hang on. Call comin' in. [He picks up.] What's that? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!
	Leela	So what did you get me?
	Bender	[impressed] A thousand and one pesos!
	Leela	Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes.
	Director #2	Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!
	Blek	Leela really bringing in the customers.
	Cygnoid Woman	This keep up, we need to buy second sauce toilet.
	Girl	When I grow up I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them just like you, Leela. Will you sign my magazine?
	Leela	Aw! Sure thing, sweetie. Who should I make it out to?
	Girl	Well, uh ... to eBay?
	Leela	That's a popular name today. Little "e" big "B"?
	Bender	Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!
	Leela	I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.
	Woman	Yeah! A role model for how to stink!
	Leela	What? Who are you?
	Woman	Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball team at NNYU and I was hoping to get to play in the majors soon.
	Leela	Oh, following in my footsteps?
	Jackie	Pft. God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real female ball players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself.
	Bender	Alright, show's over. No refunds. You heard the robot. Get out!
	Leela	I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me.
	Amy	Don't be upset, Leela. You, um ... you look really cute in your uniform.
	Leela	[crying] That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
	Bender	You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
	Leela	You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time.
	Hermes	That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time.
	Leela	Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.
	Fry	Hey, look! The players who broke the various colour barriers.
	Bender	When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
	Leela	Ah, here we are. The worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high.
	Bender	It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
	Fry	And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mitt.
	Leela	It's even a crummy hologram.
	Aaron Jr.	I'm not a hologram, though I am crummy. [He holds out his hand.] Hank Aaron XXIV.
	Fry	Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
	Aaron Sr.	No, I was better than great. I was the home run king!
	Bender	Neat!
	Leela	So, Hank-- The bad Hank. Just how blowful were you?
	Aaron Jr.	Well, I had a low batting average.
	Aaron Sr.	Low? It was zero, you fungo! You went your whole career without getting a hit.
	Fry	Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
	Aaron Sr.	You stink, lady! Hey, Junior, she belongs in the exhibit instead of you.
	Aaron Jr.	Forget it. This job's too cushy to give up. [He picks up Wade Boggs' head in a jar and drinks from it.] Ah, Wade Boggs! Goes down smooth!
	Leela	Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help. So I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you.
	Aaron Jr.	Oh, I can't help you play better than Tiny Iota. That guy was great. But I'll teach you everything I know.
	Aaron Jr.	OK, let's see what you can do.
	Bender	One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
	Leela	[quietly] Alright. Low and away.
	Aaron Jr.	OK, try it again. But this time keep your eye off the ball.
	Leela	You mean "keep your eye on the ball"?
	Aaron Jr.	Hey, lady, which one of us is in the hall of fame?
	Fry	[whispering] Pst. You're holding the bat upside down.
	Aaron Jr.	Just pitch the ball.
	Leela	OK. Eye off the ball.
	Bender	Strike!
	Fry	Hooray!
	Aaron Jr.	You did it, Leela!
	Leela	I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
	Aaron Jr.	Oh, you got that too? I think there's a rash goin' around.
	Uecker	Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Poindexters, where the Mets close out a season that'll rank among Mankind's most awful crimes.
	Fry	Hey! You opened a franchise!
	Cygnoid Woman	Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several things that look like beans.
	Fishy Joe	Beans, huh? Mmm. This is great! How to you make the crust so fizzy?
	Blek	Ah-ah-ah! Ancient Cygnoid secret!
	Cygnoid Woman	My husband, some hotshot! Here's his ancient Cygnoid secret! [She holds up a jar.] Live hornets! We smush them right into dough!
	Fishy Joe	I don't care if there's horse manure in it!
	Blek	That's a-good!
	Fishy Joe	I wanna buy this franchise. How does $100,000 sound?
	Blek	Forget it! We come to Earth to make pizza, not money.
	Cygnoid Woman	No, Blek! Other way around!
	Blek	Oh, right. Offer accepted!
	Uecker	Well, fans, Boston's turning the last game into a real "squeeeker"! And that's with three "e's"! Two men on and they're down to their last out.
	Leela	Come on, skipper. It's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in.
	Skipper	No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when we're eight runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat the traffic. [Leela turns away and sits down.] [shouting] Come on! Let's see some fundamentals out there! [The clown honks his horn.] And not clown fundamentals. [A Boston player hits the ball and it bounces over to the clown. Instead of throwing it to another player he throws a pie instead. The skipper kicks the ground.] Aw, darn, darn darn! Now the bases are loaded! Isn't there a man on this team who can get one more out?
	Leela	I can.
	Skipper	I repeat: Isn't there a man on this team on this--
	Leela	I've been training with Hank Aaron.
	Skipper	You've been training with the Hank Aaron?
	Leela	I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
	Skipper	Alright then. Get in there and pitch like you've never pitched like you before!
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] Now pitching for the Mets: Turanga Leela.
	Crowd	[chanting] Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! [The bean counters open a banner.] Go, Leela!
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] Go, Leela!
	Amy	[shouting] Come on, Leela!
	Bender	[shouting] Put it right down the pike!
	Fry	[shouting] Strike him out, Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] Your attention: Now pinch-hitting for the Poindexters: Jackie Anderson.
	Uecker	Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making her big league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything. I've never seen anything this bizarre, and I've seen Mr. Belvendere naked! Woo!
	Leela	[quietly] Keep cool. She's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time.
	Umpire	Strike one!
	Leela	Strike one, a personal best!
	Umpire	Strike two!
	Uecker	[on loudspeaker] Remember, fans, this exciting moment is brought to you by Month Old Franks, the hotdogs with experience! Mmm-mmm! [Leela and Jackie wipe their brows. Hermes wipes his brow with a sponge, and squeezes it into a file marked "Ballpark Sweat". Leela throws the ball, Jackie swings and hits it. The elastic tightens and breaks. The crowd look up and gasp. While they aren't looking, Bender chuckles and steals some drinks from the people in front of him. Amy takes one too. The un-tethered ball flies through the air and into a target marked "Hit It Here And Win The Game". The target lights up, a bell rings, Jackie runs around the pitch, the giant rats run out and the Slurm blimp crashes.] A grand slam blern. The Mets lose! Their season is over! And no question, Leela, the first woman ever to reach the Majors, will go down as the single worst player in the history of blernsball! [Leela walks sadly to the bench. Jackie jumps around with joy and the Boston players lift her up.] And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a great career for the first woman to play the sport well -- Jackie Anderson!
	Jackie	Leela?
	Leela	Jackie. I guess you were right. I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
	Jackie	No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration after all.
	Leela	[crying] I was?
	Jackie	Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something.
	Leela	Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference after all.
	Jackie	You absolutely did, Leela. Now please, please retire. Immediately.
	Leela	Hey, kid. Catch!
	Aaron Sr.	Well, at least you're still the worst football player of all time.
	Aaron Jr.	Yeah. Yeah.
