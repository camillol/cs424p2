00:45	Leela	Space pirates!
00:46	Fry	Space pirates?
00:47	Leela	You know. Pirates, but in space.
00:59	Pirate	[on screen] Avast, mateys!
01:01	Pirate	Electronically transfer your space doubloons, afore I send thee to Davey Jarg's locker!
01:11	Bender	[shouting] Hey! Keep it down, you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!
01:24	Fry	Come on! Come on!
01:32	Bender	[muttering] Make Bender take a nap in a tube. [He opens the tube, gets in a pushes a torpedo out.] [sexfully] Come back when I've had some sleep, baby!
01:47	Leela	Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
01:51	Fry	Firing torpedo number three!
01:58	Bender	Huh? What?
02:02	Leela	That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all!
02:05	Bender	Damn you, Fry and Lee-- [He flies through the pirate ship, leaving a hole in the hull and holding a bag of swag.] --la!
02:12	Pirate	[from ship] Too late do I realise that me children are me only real treasures.
02:19	Bender	[shouting] Help! Mechanical man overboard!
02:23	Fry	Go after him, Leela!
02:27	Leela	It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that.
02:32	Fry	You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?
02:36	Leela	I don't know how to say this, Fry, but Bender is doomed to drift through space ... forever.
02:45	Fry	[solemn] He always wanted to drift forever, but through the American Southwest.
02:50	Bender	I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum. [He throws swag out of the sack and spins around and slows down. He groans.] I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag. [He takes a watch out of the sack.] Ooh! Hey, universe, check out the dude with the Rolex! [He takes out a candelabra.] Wow! Ostentatious! [He sticks it to his door.] Except what good is a candelabra without-- Wait! I know! [He pulls a piano out of his chest cabinet, puts the candelabra on it and plays Polonaise in C Minor.] Ah, the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art. [He plays a bad note and groans. He tries again, plays another bad note and growls.] Damn you!
04:09	Bender	There! Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was. [An object hits him.] Hey! what's bombarding me? [More objects hit him.] Oh, no! An asteroid field. If even a pea-sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could-- [One whizzes through his skull.] Ow! Hurt slightly! [More asteroids hit him and one becomes embedded in his door. He clears the asteroid field.] Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness.
04:37	Bender	Huh?
04:45	Shrimpkin Priest	Fellow Shrimpkins, behold him who hath taken us unto his breast.
04:53	Bender	Holy frijoles!
04:54	Shrimpkin Priest	All bow before the great Metal Lord!
05:00	Bender	Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless, tragic voyage.
05:11	Shrimpkin Priest	All hail the Metal Lord!
05:14	Shrimpkins	[chanting] So hailed!
05:16	Bender	Hmm. Those peewees think I'm God, huh? Hard to blame 'em! [He picks one up and he screams. He places the Shrimpkin on his eyes.] I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?
05:25	Malachi	I am called Malachi, Lord. It means, um, "He who really loves the Metal Lord".
05:31	Bender	Listen here, Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.
05:36	Malachi	But, Lord, we are a poor and simple folk.
05:39	Bender	Poor? Oh, crap.
05:46	Malachi	Pity me not, for I am richened by the love of my family.
05:49	Malachi's Wife	What art thou doing, Malachi Jr.?
05:52	Malachi Jr.	I'm practising to hug Daddy when he gets back from God. [He hugs the pot.] Mmm! Mmm!
05:58	Bender	Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down. [He clears his throat.] Number one...
06:09	Malachi	Behold: The One Commandment.
06:12	Bender	[shouting] Make it a double!
06:15	Fry	Can you find him, Professor?
06:17	Professor Farnsworth	No. I'm afraid the Smellescope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.
06:26	Zoidberg	Hooray! People are paying attention to me!
06:35	Amy	Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up.
06:38	Hermes	His name is Helper and he's eager to be your new best friend.
06:43	Helper	Hello there, chum. I understand you miss your buddy. Have a pudding pop!
06:46	Fry	No, thanks, I don't--
06:48	Helper	Who wants to go to an amusement park?
06:49	Fry	Well, I guess that sounds OK.
06:50	Helper	Have a good time. Hey, I heard your friend Bender is back.
06:53	Fry	What? Really?
06:55	Helper	No. I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment.
07:15	Bender	Ooh! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them. [He reaches out and picks up Malachi.] Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight.
07:29	Malachi	Yes, tonight is kind of special.
07:31	Bender	Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
07:34	Malachi	Nay. Like most of your followers, I was maimed while building the Great Brewery. [The Shrimpkins lack various limbs and behind them is a large graveyard.] Others died from the pestilent fumes it spewed forth. [On the porch of her home, Malachi's wife sits with the baby.] And, of course, the liquor industry attracted organised crime.
07:58	Bender	It's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight.
08:25	Malachi's Wife	Malachi Jr., no!
08:28	Malachi Jr.	Daddy, I can't hold much longer. My arms are tired from hugging.
08:33	Malachi	Save him! Save my son, oh Metal Lord!
08:36	Bender	This looks like a job for God! [He pulls Malachi Jr. out of the tear river and puts him down on the bank. Father and son hug and the Shrimpkins gasp and bow.] What the-- Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?
08:52	Malachi	They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles.
08:57	Bender	Very well. What do they want?
08:59	Malachi	The people of that village pray for wealth.
09:10	Bender	Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?
09:18	Malachi	The farmers pray for sunlight so their barley might make a more refreshing beer for today's God on the go.
09:24	Bender	Very well. Let there be light. [He closes his eye visor and reflects the rays of a star onto the farmers' fields. They cheer but the fields burst into flames and so do the farmers.] I got it! I got it! [He blows the flames out and also blows several Shrimpkins off his body and into space.] Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.
09:51	Fry	He decided not to let go. [He puts the picture down and looks at one on the wall of Bender sat on a throne dressed as Napoleon.] I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperate and crazy!
10:10	Fry	So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?
10:16	Changstein el Gamahl	Well, we could join together in prayer.
10:19	Fry	Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?
10:22	Changstein el Gamahl	No.
10:23	Gypsy	Sure I hold s√©ance, channel your friend, no problem. Insert coin. [Fry inserts 5 cents and the Gypsy moans as she "channels" Bender.] I am your friend, Bonder.
10:34	Fry	Bonder? Is it really you?
10:36	Gypsy	Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.
10:40	Fry	Wait a minute! Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!
10:45	Gypsy	Look, you want false hope or not?
10:47	Fry	Only if you don't have any real hope.
10:49	Gypsy	Well, there is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks of Deshuba?
10:54	Fry	I've not heard of them.
10:56	Gypsy	They are an ancient order that believes God exists somewhere in the depths of space. They have built the universe's most powerful radio telescope, high in the Himalayas, to search for him.
11:08	Fry	You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
11:10	Gypsy	What am I, psychic? I mean, yes! Yes, I'm-I'm sure they will. Yes.
11:30	Malachi	Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer.
11:34	Bender	[irate] Yes, Malachi, what is it this time?
11:36	Malachi	My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded.
11:42	Bender	Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
11:47	Malachi	They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against them. Smite someone who deserves it for once.
11:55	Bender	Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems.
12:01	Malachi	But-But Metal Lord.
12:04	Bender	What part of "nay" doesn't thou understand?
12:09	Fry	Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monastery high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long-sleeved coat.
12:14	Leela	Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless.
12:20	Fry	You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go "blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!" [He is still covering his ears.] [shouting] I'd also like a pack mule.
12:29	Salesman	[shouting] At once, sir!
12:33	Leela	Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idiotic-ness and come with you. But we'll need a sherpa to guide us.
12:47	Bender	Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling-- [Bombers fly around from Bender's ass and drop bombs on the Shrimpkin village.] Atomic bombs? Oh, no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
13:05	Malachi	Fear not, my Lord. We shall be with you soon.
13:08	Bender	You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
13:12	Malachi	We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to convert the unbelievers.
13:18	Bender	Convert them?
13:19	Malachi	To radioactive vapour!
13:31	Malachi Jr.	Look, Daddy! I'm hugging God. Mmm! Mmm! Maybe if I hug him real hard he'll save us from--
13:41	Bender	[crying] No! [More bombs explode on him.] [laughing] Ooh! It tickles!
13:53	Bender	Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre? [He takes the roof off Ezekiel's Nasty House.] Don't be embarrassed. [He groans.] [crying] They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
14:17	Leela	[shouting] Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion, make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that "huddled over for warmth" crap.
14:29	Namgyal	Behold. The Monastery of Deshuba. I must leave you now for I am not holy enough to enter.
14:36	Fry	OK.
14:44	Leela	Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
14:53	Female Voice	Welcome to our monastery. Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by.
15:11	Bender	Hey! That galaxy's signalling in binary. I gotta signal back. But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is. [shouting] You speak English?
15:20	Galactic Entity	I do now.
15:28	Bender	What are you? Some kind of galactic computer?
15:30	Galactic Entity	Possible. I am user friendly, my good chum.
15:34	Bender	Who built you?
15:36	Galactic Entity	I have always been.
15:37	Bender	Oh, my God. Are you God?
15:41	"God"	Possible. I do feel compassion for all living things, my good chum.
15:46	Bender	But why would God think in binary? Unless ... you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God.
15:56	"God"	That seems probable.
16:02	Monk #1	A member of our brotherhood sits at these controls every hour of every day, scanning the heavens for God.
16:09	Monk #2	There he is! No. No, wait, no.
16:12	Leela	How long have you been at it?
16:14	Monk #1	700 years. We've not yet examined one-ten-millionth of the sky. But we will go on until we find the Almighty, even if it takes till the end of time.
16:24	Fry	And then what?
16:25	Monk #1	Then we utter unto him a short prayer. You see, the telescope is also an amplifying transmitter.
16:31	Leela	Sort of like a giant karaoke machine?
16:33	Monk #1	Not really. Would you like to see our giant karaoke machine?
16:36	Leela	Not really.
16:38	Fry	Hmm. Finding God. That-That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend, Bender.
16:45	Monk #1	I don't know what to say, other than "absolutely not". Your loss is a tragedy but our work--
16:51	Fry	Aw, come on! You guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend.
16:57	Monk #2	He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love in his heart is God.
17:02	Monk #1	Oh, how convenient! A theory about God that doesn't require looking through a telescope. Get back to work!
17:09	Fry	That telescope is as much mine as it is anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.
17:17	Leela	Hi-yah! You're order may be famous for its martial arts, but I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber.
17:23	Monk #1	Actually, we only practise martial arts as a form of meditation. We are a strictly non-violent sect.
17:28	Leela	Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
17:34	Monk #3	This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.
17:38	Bender	So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?
17:41	"God"	Yes.
17:42	Bender	What if I do something different?
17:44	"God"	Then I don't know that.
17:45	Bender	Cool! Cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you, huh?
17:49	"God"	Yes. But there are so many asking so much. After a while, you just sorta tune it out.
17:55	Bender	Y'know, I was God once.
17:57	"God"	Yes, I saw. You were doing well until everyone died.
18:01	Bender	It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
18:10	"God"	Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do.
18:14	Bender	Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did-- Forget it.
18:19	"God"	Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch like a safecracker or a pickpocket.
18:30	Bender	Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
18:33	"God"	Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
18:43	Bender	Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
18:46	"God"	Earth? Which way is that?
18:51	Bender	[sadly] I don't know.
18:53	Fry	[shouting] Bender? Bender?
18:56	Monk #2	[from laundry room] Let us out! We cooked our shoes in the dryer and ate them. Now we're bored.
19:03	Fry	[shouting] Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
19:05	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	[on speaker] No! Quit asking.
19:08	Leela	Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up.
19:17	Fry	[sad] You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he-he actually stole my blood. [He spins the dish controller.] But still, I wish I had Bender back.
19:39	"God"	Huh?
19:42	Bender	Huh? Wha? You say something?
19:43	"God"	No, no. Well, so long. Remember what we talked about.
20:02	Bender	Hot, hot, hot, hot!
20:07	Fry	Bender! It's a miracle! [He hugs him and burns himself.] Ow!
20:13	Leela	This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened.
20:17	Bender	Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!
20:23	Fry	We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
20:24	Leela	Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
20:28	Fry	Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
20:34	Bender	Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!
20:54	"God"	When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
