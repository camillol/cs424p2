	Zoidberg	Hurry up with the water. I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am. It's that hot, it is!
	Leela	Hi-yah!
	Fry	Man, it's hot! [different voice] How hot is it? [normal voice] It's so hot, I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off. [He chuckles.] Johnny Carson said it.
	Leela	No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!
	Bender	Lightweights! Oh, wait, chlorine!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
	Bender	[jittery] Focus!
	Narrator	[voice-over] Global Warming Or: None Like It Hot!
	Narrator	[in movie] You're probably wondering why your ice cream went away. Well, Suzie, the culprit isn't foreigners, it's global warming!
	Suzie	[in movie] Gwobal wappa?
	Narrator	[in movie.] Uh, yeah! Meet Mr. Sunbeam. He comes all the way from the sun to visit Earth.
	Mr. Sunbeam	[in movie.] Hello, Earth! Just poppin' in to brighten your day! [He hums a tune.] And now I'll be on my way!
	Gas	[in movie] Not so fast, Sunbeam! We're greenhouse gases. You ain't goin' nowhere!
	Mr. Sunbeam	[in movie] Ooh! Ah! Oh, God, it hurts!
	Narrator	[in movie] Pretty soon, Earth is chock-full of sunbeams ... [Dead Sunbeams are piled up.] ... their rotting corpses heating our atmosphere.
	Suzie	[in movie] How do we get wid of the gweenhouse grasses?
	Narrator	[in movie] Fortunately, our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap, last-minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063 we simply drop a giant ice cube into the ocean every now and then.
	Suzie	[in movie] Just like Daddy puts in his drink every morning. And then he gets mad.
	Narrator	[in movie] Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time. [There are shots of bigger ice cubes being dropped into the ocean.] Thus solving the problem once and for all.
	Suzie	[in movie] But--
	Narrator	[angry; in movie.] Once and for all!
	Leela	Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it. [The phone rings. Leela answers.] Hello?
	Richard Nixon	[on screen] President Nixon here. [Zoidberg salutes.] I'm hiring you losers to deliver the ice. And hurry up! I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle!
	Prof. Farnsworth	You heard the good news, everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera, et cetera! [He stands up and starts ushering them out.] Bye!
	Fry	Wait! Where do we get the ice?
	Prof. Farnsworth	The wha? Oh, Halley's Comet, of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them.
	Fry	Wow! Mining a comet! That sounds fun.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're perched on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour. [He mimes a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour.] Safe!
	Bender	[shouting] Deploying ice drill.
	Fry	Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you! [He chuckles.] Yakov Smirnov said it.
	Leela	No, he didn't.
	Bender	[shouting] Activating ice drill.
	Fry	Oh, my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!
	Leela	Completely out of ice?
	Bender	This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it ... also life.
	Linda	[on TV] With Halley's Comet out of ice, Earth is experiencing the devastating effects of sudden intense global warming.
	Morbo	[on TV] Morbo is pleased but sticky. The scorching heat has melted the polar ice caps, causing floods of biblical proportion.
	Randy Munchnik	[on TV] They called me crazy for building this ark.
	Soupy	[on TV] You are crazy. You filled it with same-sex animal couples!
	Randy Munchnik	[on TV] Hey! There are parts of the Bible I like and parts I don't like.
	Morbo	[voice-over; on TV] Direct your attention now to the African turtles seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland.
	Bender	[crying] That poor turtle!
	Fry	Bender? Are you crying?
	Bender	[crying] Uh, no! Never!
	Morbo	[on TV] Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads peace among the Dutch tulips.
	Linda	[on TV] I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
	Morbo	[shouting; on TV] Windmills do not work that way! [He turns to the camera.] Goodnight!
	Bender	Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle. What have you done with your lives?
	Hermes	You went all the way to Holland already?
	Leela	Bender, a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
	Bender	Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.
	Hermes	What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
	Bender	For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell. [He bangs his casing then the turtle's shell.] But lead a rich, inner life. And also ... well, you know.
	Leela	You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gamblers?
	Bender	No! It's just ... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
	Fry	What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
	Bender	Those times I was slightly on my side.
	Hermes	Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours, Bender.
	Bender	Uh, no! That's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me. [Amy crouches behind Bender and he trips over her and he and the turtle land on their backs.] Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you.
	Van	Calling all scientists, calling all scientists. Be advised there will be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan.
	Man	I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!
	Van	You've got a degree in baloney!
	Amy	Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up, all of you!
	Hermes	Strange. You haven't acted this suspicious since I found those "ape bones" in the basement.
	Prof. Farnsworth	My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I am not just making excuses! Alright, I'll go!
	Woman #1	[shouting] Oh, God, I can't believe it!
	Woman #2	[shouting] I love you!
	Rivers	Oh, oh, oh! It's Hubert Farnsworth! He's looking sharp in a standard white lab coat and dark slacks! His wristwatch is a Casio.
	Van	Thank you all for coming. It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention. The inventor of the environment and first Emperor of the Moon: Al Gore.
	Al Gore	I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm.
	Fry	Good for him!
	Al Gore	My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book Earth In The Balance and the much more popular Harry Potter And The Balance Of Earth, we need to defend our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards.
	Dark Wizard	Sure! Blame the wizards!
	Al Gore	That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon Sapphires to the first scientist who can solve this problem once and for all. [The audience "Ooh's".] Lovely, aren't they?
	Dark Wizard	Sapphires? [He cackles.] With those I could open the Gate of Kerash!
	Al Gore	First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wernstrom!
	Wernstrom	Ladies and gentlemen, I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 40% of the sun's rays, thus cooling Earth. Observe.
	Wernstrom	Problem solved.
	Man	Ooh! That's a little bright.
	Al Gore	Alright, what else we got?
	Fry	Professor, you're a professor. You must have some ideas.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
	Al Gore	Our next speaker is Professor--
	Prof. Farnsworth	I demand the floor!
	Al Gore	Yes, it's your turn to speak.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! [He walks on stage.] I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Oh, it haunts my memory still.
	Fry	Professor, no! Don't do it!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?
	Prof. Farnsworth	[voice-over] It was October 17th at 1:54pm and 14 birds were flying by the window. I was working at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. Back then, you see, robots were slow-moving, stiff and a little on the uptight side.
	Prototype	Oh, dear. Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, I've failed again.
	Prototype	Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[voice-over] The owner of the company pressured me to create a bigger sportier robot.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Stop!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[voice-over] It wasn't easy but, by sacrificing fuel efficiency, I succeeded.
	Mom	What was that?
	Prof. Farnsworth	A flaming burp.
	Mom	Does it always do that?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's not always a burp. We still have one problem though: This robot will never meet emission standards.
	Mom	Crap spackle! [She slaps him.] We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[voice-over] What a fool I was. If only I had made the effort to develop a cleaner-burning robot. But I was tired and in love.
	Mom	Take me now, you stud!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, this is all my fault!
	Fry	That's awful, Professor. Especially the making-out part.
	Al Gore	Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.
	Prof. Farnsworth	All modern robots descend from my original smog-blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today.
	Wernstrom	Huh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected. [He speaks into the microphone.] We are left with only one possible course of action, grim though it be.
	Bender	I got a good feeling about this!
	Wernstrom	We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots!
	Bender	No!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wait, surely there's a better--
	Van	The conference is over.
	Al Gore	I must go now, to help collect cans on Jupiter. Peace out, y'all!
	Crowd	[chanting] Destroy all robots! Destroy all robots!
	Amy	Poor Bender.
	Fry	Be brave, my friend.
	Leela	Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime. [She holds up a bottle of beer.] Would you do it for a Bender snack?
	Fry	Aha!
	Leela	Gotcha!
	Bender	Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer! [They struggle with the bottle. Bender pulls it away and runs off with it.] Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now? [He cackles and his head comes out. He drinks the beer and flag appears on his antenna.] I've got mail!
	Amy	Ooh! It's a party, apparently.
	Richard Nixon	[on card] Do you like to party? To boogie down? Well I'm throwing an all-night beach raver for my robot pals. It all goes down Saturday on the isolated Galapagos Islands where there will be no escape ... from the fun! All robots must attend.
	Zoidberg	Strange: Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, suddenly throw a party, one of the most social events imaginable? [He snaps his claws.] It's a trap, is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots! [No one reacts.] I don't hear any gasping.
	Leela	We all figured that out.
	Bender	Well, I'm off.
	Fry	Wait! We could hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
	Bender	No. I'm going to the party.
	Fry	I won't let you!
	Bender	Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Mally's weed whacker. But, at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for: This mindless turtle.
	Fry	Bender, this world isn't good enough for you.
	Bender	Not even close. Goodbye, everybody! Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead. [He leaves.] [shouting] It's booby trapped!
	Robot #1	Oh, yeah!
	Robot #2	Come on, baby!
	Bender	Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink. [He pumps a keg but it is dry.] Crummy keg! It's completely ta-- Oh, you're a robot!
	Keg Robot	Don't stop!
	Bender	Ew!
	Richard Nixon	Attention, happening robots: Who's got what it takes to party with Nixon? [The robots cheer.] You fellas enjoy yourselves for the next two hours. And be sure not to leave the island, uh, for at least two hours. I'm going out to pick up some smokes ... uh, really good smokes. Two hours. [The robots cheer.] OK, headless body of Agnew, let's blow this joint!
	Crushinator	[mechanical voice] Do you want to dance?
	Bender	Nah, I'm not really in the--
	Crushinator	[mechanical voice] You know you want to.
	Wernstrom	Per your orders, I modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galapagos. Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated. Now for your part of the bargain.
	Richard Nixon	Aroo! Very well. Agnew, you belong to Wernstrom now.
	Bender	I'll say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. [whispering] Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and--
	Boom Mic-bot	[shouting] What?
	Robot #3	[shouting] We're gonna die!
	Preacherbot	[shouting] We're going to the great beyond!
	Chain Smoker	[shouting] Nixon's not bringing the smokes!
	Bender	Shut up and pay attention to me, Bender! [The robots stop panicking and turn around. Roberto stabs the robot who couldn't make his payments in Bender Gets Made.] Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here. Except perhaps you, Hedonismbot. [The Hedonismbot eats grapes.] But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonismbot!
	Hedonismbot	I apologise for nothing!
	Bender	We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
	Preacherbot	To hell with the turtles!
	Bender	No one insults the turtles!
	Preacherbot	Oh, mercy!
	Bender	Come on!
	Hedonismbot	Let the games begin!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Everyone, listen!
	Preacherbot	Aw, damn!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time. Granted, you're all blasting out greenhouse gases--
	Bender	[shouting] You're one to talk!
	Prof. Farnsworth	But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst, it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it. [The robots "Ooh".] By my calculations, we'll need the full force of every last robot. So, quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards. [The robots turn their exhausts up.] Now vent! Vent like the wind! [The robots vent. A huge flame rises into the sky but nothing happens.] Harder! Harder!
	Fry	Why isn't this working?!
	Leela	Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.
	Bender	Help! Help!
	Prof. Farnsworth	A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished. Oh, the Jedis are going to feel this one!
	Bender	I'm sorry, buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless. [The turtle starts to rock from side to side.] Huh? What the hell are you doing? [It rocks onto it's feet and walks away.] Hey, you trying to make me look bad? [He rocks on his back, working his body with his arms and manages to get up.] Aha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fulfill my destiny.
	Richard Nixon	Fire! [Wernstrom presses a button but the pulse misses.] What the--?
	Wernstrom	We missed!
	Richard Nixon	Professor, for saving the Earth and foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, present you with Earth's new highest honour: The Polluting Medal of Pollution.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Thank you. I deserve this!
	Bender	Hey, Professor, now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun, won't that make the year longer?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Why, yes! One week longer to be exact.
	Richard Nixon	In that case I hereby declare it Robot Party Week!
	Bender	Alright, baby!
