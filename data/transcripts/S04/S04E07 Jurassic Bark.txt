	Bender	For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves ... [He rolls his arms up.] ... and nothing in my head. [He takes his head off shows it to his "audience" and replaces it.] So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk... [He rolls up a newspaper and pours the milk into it. He then unrolls the newspaper.] Behold, the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!
	Fry	Amazing! That's why they call you "Bender the Magnificent"!
	Bender	No, it isn't.
	Fry	Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th century pizzeria, just like the one I used to work at.
	Bender	Interesting. No, wait, the other thing ... tedious.
	Fry	Let's go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
	Bender	You lived before you met me?
	Fry	Sure. Lots of people did.
	Bender	Really?
	Bender	Truly, they were as gods who built this place!
	Tour Guide	Next, we come to the splendidly-preserved wooden pizza paddle. [She presses a button and a robot chef bats a robot delivery boy with the paddle.] Scientists theorise it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy.
	Fry	Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! [He grabs the paddle.] And for your information, lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt. It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats.
	Tour Guide	I don't know where you get your facts, sir, but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation and a Harlequin romance about archaeologists.
	Fry	Don't wave your fancy degrees at me! I recognise all this stuff. [He walks over to a display case.] Petrified sausages, old Mr. Patelli. And that's--
	Man	[on intercom] Yes?
	Fry	Pizza delivery for Mr. ... [He checks the note.] ... Seymour Asses.
	Man	[on intercom] There's no one by that name here ... or anywhere. I hope that in time you'll realise what an idiot you've been.
	Fry	I wouldn't count on that.
	Fry	Aw! Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here ... [He offers the dog a slice.] ... but if Mr. Panucci asks, your name is Seymour Asses. [The dog snaffles the slice.] I like you, Seymour. You're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs ... are you? Nah! We understand each other. [He hands Seymour another slice.] People think you're just a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and you call no man "Mister". [He gets up and gets on his bike.] Well, goodbye. [He does the Vulcan salute.] Live long and prosper.
	Bender	Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
	Fry	No! That's my dog in there. It's an outrage, I say! [He grabs Bender by his foot and uses him to smash the display case. He takes Seymour and Bender hops around holding his foot, screaming in pain.] I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me. [Two security guards grab him.] Uh-oh!
	Bender	And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified.
	Fry	Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
	Amy	Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
	Fry	I know. I was deliberately describing a similar situation.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians; always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
	Bender	Nah, protesting never works.
	Fry	You're right. [He gets up.] I'll give it a shot!
	Crowd	[chanting] What do you want?
	Fry	[into megaphone] Fry's dog!
	Crowd	[chanting] When do you want it?
	Fry	[into megaphone.] Fry's dog! [The crowd cheers.] I will now perform my people's native dance.
	Leela	It says this part of The Hustle implores the gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
	Fry	[singing] I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh! [Seymour howls along with the tune.] I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh! [He locks his bike up.] [talking] That a boy, Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always. Just like that huge mushroom in my shower.
	Mr. Panucci	Hey! There's our little mascot. [Seymour shakes himself.] Aw, you been swimming in the sewer again? [He rubs Seymour down with the pizza dough.] You rascal! [He ladles tomato sauce onto the dough. Some spills onto the floor.] Fry, cleanup!
	Fry	Seymour, cleanup! [Seymour licks up the tomato sauce.] Good dog!
	Mr. Panucci	That's a good Seymour!
	Boy	Yo! There's dog fur on my slice!
	Mr. Panucci	Nah, that's vermicelli! No fur in here!
	Fry	He's so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooh, three things!
	Leela	Fry, it's been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort.
	Ben Beeler	Mr. Fry? I'm Dr. Ben Beeler, the palaeontologist who discovered your dog. Or as some call it, the "Beelersaurus".
	Fry	So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
	Ben Beeler	No, we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time.
	Fry	His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus.
	Ray	The 29? Interesting.
	Ben Beeler	That's all I needed. Ray?
	Ray	I'm good.
	Ben Beeler	OK then. Here's your dog back.
	Fry	Seymour!
	Bender	Lady and gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
	Zoidberg	I was all in this part! It's magic!
	Bender	You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
	Zoidberg	Stop!
	Fry	Good news, everyone!
	Bender	Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!
	Prof. Farnsworth	No. Actually we've discovered that Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!
	Fry	Which means we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
	Zoidberg	A little land mammal!
	Fry	Can you believe it, Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
	Cubert	Why the idiot convention?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog using the very same apparatus I used to clone you. [He looks into the cloning tank.] Ooh, look! There's a smidge of toe still in here. [He picks it up and hands it to Cubert. He walks over to a computer and presses a button and Seymour appears.] You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat.
	Fry	So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Amazingly, yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death.
	Fry	I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!
	Bender	Crappy ineffective Reaper!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
	Computer Voice	The dog says--
	Prof. Farnsworth	Uh-oh, this may take a while.
	Boy	You stink, loser!
	Mr. Panucci	Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!
	Fry	But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.
	Mr. Panucci	Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millennium and you'll be a delivery boy next millennium! [Fry sighs and picks up the pizza. He walks to the door. Seymour grabs his trouser leg and holds Fry back.] What's with Seymour? It's like he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short, or somethin'. Which is crazy 'cause, frankly, you look fabulous. Now get goin'!
	Fry	I won't be gone long, Seymour. Just wait here till I come back.
	Fry	Hello? Pizza delivery for ... [He reads the delivery note.] ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! [He sits down and opens the can.] Here's to another lousy millennium.
	Crowd	[chanting] Five, four, three, two.
	Fry	What the--?
	Bender	A dog collar, for me? [He puts it on.] You shouldn't have!
	Fry	That's for Seymour.
	Bender	Oh.
	Bender	Say, why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? [He puts on some glasses.] That's not a reputable journal of opinion.
	Fry	Oh, that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
	Bender	Are you on the junk, Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?
	Fry	Hey, he was smart! He could fetch.
	Bender	I can fetch.
	Fry	He could dig up bones.
	Bender	Hello? Charlemange? [He opens his chest cabinet door, revealing bones and a crown.] Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head.
	Fry	Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you.
	Bender	That's impossible!
	Fry	Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
	Bender	No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says "Bender" on it. [Fry hammers the sign on but the hammer head flies off and hits Bender.] Ow!
	Fry	[on phone] This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each.
	Mr. Fry	Phil, it's your father. Where are you? You're holding up New Year's brunch. Your brother can't wait any longer.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Hello, first baloney of the new millennium! [Seymour barks from outside.] Ah, here he comes. That's him and Seymour.
	Mrs. Fry	Well that's weird. Seymour's here but-- [She turns to the TV.] Go! Go! Touchdown! But where's Philip?
	Mr. Fry	I'm tellin' you, the Y2K computer's got him. We'll face burnin' roads, rivers exploding, calculators transformed into Scud missiles. There's nothing we can do. [Seymour climbs onto the TV and barks Walking On Sunshine.] What's that, Seymour? You walking on sunshine?
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Should we follow him?
	Mr. Fry	To our deaths? Negatory.
	Mr. Fry	It's the Y2K tryin' to lure us into an ambush. And I ain't buyin' it. Pass the baloney.
	Fry	Are you two gonna be done soon?
	Leela	Sorry, but we need to practise hand-to-hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands and they slide way across the room.
	Fry	Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
	Leela	OK.
	Bender	Heel, boy, heel! Oh, hello, Fry! I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy.
	Fry	[indifferent] That's nice.
	Bender	I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere, boy! Pet, pet, pet.
	Robo-Puppy	Robo-Puppy receiving petting.
	Amy	Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!
	Bender	Jealous? [He laughs and picks up Robo-Puppy.] Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.
	Robo-Puppy	Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek. [It's tongue comes out.] Robo-Puppy commencing cheek-licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.
	Bender	Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend, huh?
	Fry	Ah, there! Perfect!
	Holo-Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! The Clone-O-Mat is ready!
	Fry	Finally!
	Robo-Puppy	Robo-Puppy commencing two-hour yipping session. [It starts to yip and Bender kicks it against the wall.] Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Behold once more, the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself. [Lightning strikes and the staff "Ooh".] I speak, of course, of molten lava deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Powering up Clone-O-Mat. [He plugs in the cord and the Clone-O-Mat bubbles.] Placing fossil on the Plat-Clone-O-Form. [He puts Seymour down.] Initiating dog brain CAT scan.
	Fry	Come on, boy! Come back to life!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Know ye now what feels like to be dog god! Commencing DNA extraction.
	Bender	Fry, c'mon, the talent show!
	Fry	What? I'm in the middle of something.
	Bender	But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?
	Fry	Bender, enough! Leave me alone!
	Bender	So that's how it is, huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch!
	Leela	No!
	Zoidberg	Oh!
	Bender	Now I'm all you got!
	Fry	I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man! [He kicks him.] Ow!
	Bender	So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
	Fry	May yet? Really?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite; The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan. [He takes an ice swan out of the freezer and takes it towards the lava. It immediately melts.] Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived.
	Fry	So Seymour might still exist?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Perhaps, for a few minutes. It's dolomite, baby!
	Fry	Then I'm goin' in after him.
	Amy	[shouting] No!
	Leela	[shouting] Stop!
	Fry	He'd come after me!
	Leela	Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
	Fry	Then all hope is lost. [He lifts himself up and looks at the lava.] Goodbye, Seymour.
	Bender	Please stop crying, Fry. Here. [He hands him a coloured handkerchief which is tied to several more in his sleeve.] I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done?
	Zoidberg	You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
	Bender	Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty. [He looks into the lava.] I'm goin' in!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite.
	Bender	I'm 40% dolomite! [He bangs his chest and dives in. His hat and cape float on the surface and everyone gasps. Bender swims through the lava and his casing starts to come apart.] Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!
	Cryogenisist	Ugh! I am one hungover cryogenisist. Just throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners get here.
	Plumber	You can't solve all your problems by freezing them, boss.
	Cryogenisist	I think you're forgetting our motto.
	Mr. Fry	Are you the cryogenisist who called about our son's dog?
	Cryogenisist	Oh, you must be the Frys. Yeah, he's right over there.
	Mrs. Fry	Sorry we're late. We all got sick from eating bad baloney.
	Mr. Fry	Y2K!
	Mrs. Fry	What's he so worked up about?
	Mr. Fry	He's just upset 'cause our boy's missing. [He clips a lead onto Seymour.] C'mon, you overgrown rat. Lead us to Philip.
	Leela	Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Professor! Lava! Hot!
	Fry	This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back. [He cries. The ground starts to shake and Bender erupts through it with Seymour.] Bender!
	Bender	And that is why they call me Bender the Magnificent! [His eyes melt and fall out.] Hey, where'd everybody go?
	Bender	OK! Let's clone us some dog!
	Fry	Yeah!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin! [He pulls the chain again and Seymour is zapped and his DNA is extracted. "Species: Canais Familiaris. Age: 15" is displayed on a screen.] Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15.
	Fry	15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Indeed.
	Fry	Stop the cloning.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
	Bender	Fry, what's wrong?
	Fry	Think about it: Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
	Bender	But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
	Fry	I had Seymour till he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him. [He picks up Seymour's fossil.] I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago.
