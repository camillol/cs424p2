	TV Commentator	[voice-over] Welcome to the games of the 3004 Earth Olympiad. Continuing this network's tradition of sports-casting excellence. [On the track, competitors walk by. Robots from Cyberia, Joe from The Nation of Joe and prisoners from Devil's Island.] Celebrity Ape Fight will return next week at its regular time.
	Fry	So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the food court?
	Amy	How 'bout those guys?
	Leela	No, they're from the Republic of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood. [He, Fry, Leela and Amy get up and leave. They pass some fans holding a "Go Sweden!" banner.] Sweden? I don't think so!
	Hermes	Go on, stick, touch me! Can't do it!
	LaBarbara	Husband, you haven't been an Olympic-class limbo-er for 20 years! Quit lying to your podgy self.
	Leela	It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
	Amy	Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?
	Hermes	Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport.
	LaBarbara	That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself.
	Hermes	And I said I'd try my very best.
	Fry	But have they seen your ... y'know ... physique, since the old days?
	Hermes	I described it to them on the phone ... using a series of artful euphemisms.
	Professor Farnsworth	Don't worry. The fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed. [Hermes wriggles into the bodysuit.] It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees.
	Hermes	Ooh, that's snug! [Something creaks.] Oh, those haven't descended in years.
	Professor Farnsworth	Now that's a limbo-er's body!
	LaBarbara	Look at that fine Jamaican bacon!
	Bender	Shut up, Zoidberg! The robot bending events are starting. [The robots flex their robot muscles.] Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals. [A crane drops three unbendable girders into the hands of a robot. The robot bends them with little effort. Bender gasps as he watches. The robot holds up the bent girders.] Wow! That guy must be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began.
	Zoidberg	Welcome to my life!
	Female Announcer	[on loudspeaker] Athletes, please take your lanes for the men's 500 metre limbo.
	Barbados Slim	Hermes Conrad, is that you inside that dumpy little fat man?
	Hermes	Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados.
	Barbados Slim	Yes and I be going back there with a gold medal draped around my elegant Caribbean shoulders.
	Hermes	Your body may be as perfectly-sculpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped my fat ass every time we met. [He pulls the bodysuit hood over his hair.] But today, I feel lucky.
	Barbados Slim	I see you're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense!
	Hermes	That's it, Barbados Slim. You've gone one toke over the line!
	Man	Limbo-ers, on your marks. Get rubbery. Limbo!
	Commentator	[voice-over] There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God, I hope he wins. [Hermes gasps as he runs.] What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limbo-ed out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell, Barbados Slim!
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] Go, bodysuit, go!
	Zoidberg	[shouting] Go!
	Bender	[shouting] C'mon!
	LaBarbara	[shouting] C'mon, Hermes, beat that mahogany god!
	Commentator	[voice-over] It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead! [Hermes pants as he passes Barbados Slim and they go down under the last stick. A ball of flab on Hermes starts to float up the bodysuit. It tears the bodysuit and knocks the limbo stick away. Hermes falls to the ground and Barbados Slim crosses the finish line.] And Conrad is disqualified! Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!
	LaBarbara	Aw, there, there, Hermes. [She pats his flab.] You did your best. If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim.
	Bender	Well, enough about Hermes. I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending, the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarrassed. I wish everybody else was dead.
	Female Announcer	[on loudspeaker] Up next, the Fembot bending competition.
	Bender	Fembots? [He chuckles.] Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace.
	Bender	What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh ... Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!
	Official	Yes but "Robonia" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot.
	Bender	Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
	Commentator	[voice-over] And it's straight! Coilette wins!
	Commentator	[voice-over] Another gold medal for the spunky maid from Robonia.
	Commentator	[voice-over] A perfect bend and a flawless entry. No splash at all! [Three robot officials hold up their scores. A 10.0, another 10.0 and a 9.9. Bender's dress falls revealing his underwear and the last judge changes his score to 10.0.] Perfect scores! A record five gold medals for Coilette!
	Bender	I'm great! Everybody else sucks! Except that guy Bender. He's really somethin'!
	Female Announcer	[on loudspeaker] All medallists report for gender testing.
	Leela	You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
	Bender	[crying] Oh, God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career. [He stops crying.] Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
	Bender	I don't need friends. I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!
	Professor Farnsworth	Bender, a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well, let's get started!
	Leela	No, you can't!
	Amy	If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women--
	Bender	Pft.
	Professor Farnsworth	I'm sorry, ladies, but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!
	Bender	[whispering] C'mon!
	Fry	I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However, I will watch out of curiosity.
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] Quiet! [talking] I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender, delicate form.
	Professor Farnsworth	Draining male oil. [Oil pours out of Bender into a tray. Amy faints. Farnsworth hooks up a tin of Femzoil.] Infusing female oil. [Bender looks worried. Farnsworth holds up some shears.] Removing item.
	Robot	We can't wait for Coilette any longer, damnit. I have to get home to watch The Zombie Osbournes.
	Coilette	I'm ready for my test now, boys.
	Coilette	[singing] Hail, hail, Robonia. A land I didn't make up.
	Coilette	[on TV] Ooh, yeah! Come on, baby! Boom!
	Coilette	Oh, yeah, baby! C'mon! Work your cans! That's it! Shake it out!
	Leela	I don't know which I'm more: Enraged or disgusted.
	Coilette	I'm just out there making us ladies look good.
	Amy	Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
	Fry	But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
	Coilette	Of course not.
	Professor Farnsworth	Dear Lord! A coaster! The Femzoil must be sachet-ing girlishly into your processor.
	Coilette	Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway. [The phone rings. Coilette giggles and skips over to it. She picks it up.] Hello? What? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0? I'd love to! [She gasps.] My own limo? No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one. [She hangs up.] I need a rain check on that nad-swap, Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon, Fry. Help me pick out a pantsuit.
	Humorbot 5.0	So, Calculon, do you want to set up this clip from All My Circuits?
	Calculon	No, I think it's self-explanatory.
	Calculon	[melodramatically; on TV] Nooo!
	Calculon	Funny story: The script called for me to say "yes" but I gave it a little twist.
	Humorbot 5.0	Anecdote accepted. Snappy comeback not found. Please put your hands together for my next guest. Winner of five Olympic medals, Coilette from Robonia. [Enter Coilette. She blows kisses to the audience and struts over to a seat. She shakes Humorbot 5.0's hand and sits down.] So, Coilette, many young Fembot's wish to emulate you. Any advice for them?
	Coilette	Yes, Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out and jiggle their Jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it now? [The audience hoots.] Alright then! [Music plays.] Woo! Look out, baby! Work it out! Ooh, shake that thing! You gotta use it, lady! Shake it up a little! That's right. Come on! Look at that!
	Calculon	Madam, I am one impressed celebrity.
	Coilette	Oh, I bet you say that to all the five-Olympic-gold medal-winning Fembots!
	Calculon	[sexfully] From this day forward I shall do so whenever possible.
	Coilette	Golly ... what?
	Calculon	Coilette, this may be presumptuous--
	Coilette	That's my favourite kind of this!
	Calculon	But I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime.
	Coilette	Calculon, you'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farmgirl's fantasy.
	Calculon	Of course I would.
	Coilette	This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
	Amy	Yes.
	Coilette	Perfect.
	Fry	You gotta tell me: You're not actually attracted to Calculon, right? And if you are, don't tell me. Are you?
	Coilette	Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is that so much to ask?
	Leela	Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace and I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
	Coilette	Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more! [She pastes it on around her mouth.] Ooh, yeah! That's the stuff! Men love it when you really glob it on.
	Leela	No, they don't.
	Amy	No way!
	Coilette	Oh, please! Every man wants a tramp. No wonder you girls aren't married. [She giggles.] I tell you, men are so much better at being women.
	Fry	But what if he wants to-- I mean, if he tries to ... uh ... Barry White?
	Coilette	I'll just tell him I need a commitment first. That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe!
	Hermes	Good Lord, man! What kind of temporary woman are you?
	Coilette	Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself without being judged?
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women. Particularly you, Leela.
	Leela	I'm worried about him too, Professor.
	Elzar	Hey, ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump. Bam!
	Calculon	I'd appreciate it if you didn't bam the young lady.
	Elzar	Well, I'd appreciate it if I did. So I guess we're even.
	Calculon	You know, Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am. You're such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you. [Coilette belches fire.] And there it is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I! [He strokes her hand.] I've never met anyone like you.
	Coilette	Oh, yes, you have.
	Calculon	Coilette, I'd like to spend some [whispering] quality time with you.
	Coilette	What? Ah! Whoa! No way! Not gonna happen. What kind of girl do you think I am?
	Calculon	Have I mentioned that I own the world's biggest and most elegant yacht?
	Coilette	Woo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!
	Amy	No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop! [She points to the gifts, a cheque for "Cash" and a vase of puppies on the table.] I think Calculon's falling for you.
	Coilette	Bah! Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game.
	Calculon	Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night, although, as a robot, I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because I love you so. [Enter Boxy.] Oh, my darling ... [Calculon opens Boxy's head, takes out a ring and goes down on his knees.] ... Will you marry me?
	Coilette	Oh, Calculon! Yes, I will!
	Amy	[whispering] Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
	Fry	I'll miss you, buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you, man.
	Coilette	The marriage is a scam.
	Fry	Cool. What's for dinner?
	Leela	What do you mean "a scam"?
	Coilette	I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into a guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid scheme.
	Fry	That's marriage alright!
	Leela	That is so unbelievably manipulative.
	Coilette	Come on! You never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?
	Leela	Well I, uh, I thought I might like him on a full stomach.
	Coilette	Nice try, sister. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to meet with my wedding planner. [shouting] Zoidberg. [Enter Zoidberg with a pile of eight wedding dress catalogues.] [talking] Zoidypoo, please tell me frilly is in this year.
	Zoidberg	I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late at night it haunts me with its frosted beauty. [shouting] Order the cake, damnit!
	Calculon	I have something for you.
	Coilette	A remote control? You got me a TV?
	Calculon	No, my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart. It symbolises the power you have to sway my emotions.
	Coilette	Will it work on my TV?
	Calculon	We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette, if I weren't able to spend my life with you I would leap from this very balloon.
	Coilette	Come on with that. Really?
	Calculon	Yes! We were meant to be.
	Coilette	So ... you really and truly love me?
	Calculon	So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with you.
	Coilette	But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness.
	Calculon	I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard ... with you.
	Coilette	[crying] Would we have donkeys?
	Calculon	All you could eat!
	Coilette	[crying] Oh, take me in your arms and compress me. Compress me tight!
	Calculon	Stop! Let us climb to the heavens that the gods themselves might envy us!
	Coilette	[crying] I just don't think I can go through with this scam.
	Amy	What?
	Fry	So now you do wanna marry him?
	Coilette	[crying] No, I just don't wanna hurt him, or humiliate him. Oh, curse this woman's heart!
	Fry	Eck!
	Professor Farnsworth	You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back, you ding bat!
	Leela	OK, look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?
	Coilette	[crying] Uh-huh.
	Leela	Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain.
	Leela	[whispering] OK, is everyone ready?
	Fry	Check.
	Amy	Uh-huh.
	Hermes	Yep!
	Zoidberg	Basically.
	Preacherbot	Dearly beloved actors and casting people who might be looking for someone to play a preacher, I welcome you. The bride has written some vows that we will now all pretend to be interested in.
	Coilette	Dearest Calculon, forever is not enough time to tell you of the many ways I love you.
	Hedonismbot	Oh, my!
	Calculon	Is there a doctor in the--
	Zoidberg	I came as soon as I could. [He puts a stethoscope to Coilette's head and gasps.] It appears to be a case of African hydraulic fever!
	Calculon	Dear God! The very illness my TV character caught in season two when I was holding out for more money. It's often fatal.
	Coilette	Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever.
	Calculon	Of course. But, smoochiepups, I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever deep in the diamond mines of the Congo.
	Leela	[shouting] Coilette, you she-devil! [The crowd gasps.] You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?
	Coilette	[shouting] Those gems belong to the natives!
	Leela	Hi-yah!
	Calculon	Oh, how cruel and melodramatic fate is. [shouting] Why?
	Coilette	Calculon, my darling, your loud "why" brought me partway back to life. [Fry rides a motorcycle through the buffet table and up the aisle. He stops and Calculon and Coilette take a step back.] Congo Jack!
	Calculon	Another shocking twist!
	Fry	Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumbay! He says this ... [He pulls out a spear.] ... is from Congo Jack.
	Coilette	Uh, um...
	Calculon	No! Nooo! [shouting] N-O-O-O!
	Coilette	I won't leave you. Not until I'm sure you understand the thing I said before. About my eternal love for you burning ... [She gags.] ... et cetera.
	Calculon	[crying] I do. I do.
	Coilette	OK then.
	Zoidberg	[eating] I'm a doctor, she's dead.
	Calculon	She lives no more. But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly loved me. To honour my pain, I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory. And this time, the Academy will not deny me. Not when they see Coilette: The Calculon Story.
	Calculon	[on TV] Coilette, your death fills me with sorrow, [angry] anger, [fearful] fear, [normal] every emotion an actor can display.
	Professor Farnsworth	Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
	Coilette	Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh!
	Fry	Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals.
	Coilette	It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
	Professor Farnsworth	Almost done.
	Coilette	If only somehow, someway, he and I could--
	Bender	Drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!
	Fry	Yay! My buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
	Leela	I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
	Bender	Yeah, you'd think, but what you gonna do?
	Calculon	[on TV] Coilette, the skies themselves weep upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
	Leela	Aw!
	Amy	Aw!
	Fry	Ew!
	Zoidberg	Gross.
	Professor Farnsworth	Sentimental drivel-poop.
	Fry	C'mon, Bender, let's go. This chick-flick is getting me all barfy.
	Bender	Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
	Calculon	[on TV] Goodnight, Coilette, my turtle dove.
	Bender	Goodnight, Calculon.
	Leela	What did you say?
	Bender	I said you two don't dress trampy enough. [He walks out.] I still got it!
