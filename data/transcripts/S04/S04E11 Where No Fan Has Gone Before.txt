	Shatner	[voice-over] Shatner's log, airdate ... unknown.
	Shatner	The impossible has happened. It would take days to recount the events I have witnessed. So, settle in. It all began--
	Zapp	Quiet, you! This court martial is now in session. The honourably sexy Zapp Brannigan residing. Bring in the accused.
	George Takei	Oh, my!
	Zapp	Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet, Omega 3, a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences. Do you understand the charges?
	Kif	One beep for "yes", two beeps for "no".
	Zapp	"Yes". So noted. Do you plead guilty? [Fry beeps twice.] Double "yes". Guilty! I will now carry out the punishment. Kif, my gun.
	Leela	Wait! He pled "not guilty".
	Zapp	Order! [He taps a bell.] Order in the court! Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount the events that led you to be guilty.
	Leela	The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies.
	Bender	Let's take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
	Fry	You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!
	Clerk	[shouting] Everybody hit the deck!
	Leela	[whispering] Sh! Those words are forbidden!
	Fry	What words? Star Trek?
	Leela	Sh!
	Zoidberg	Shut your gills!
	Bender	That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
	Zapp	The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words from someone with a sexily seductive voice.
	George Takei	With pleasure. You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars.
	Zapp	You mean after the vast migration of Star Wars fans?
	Nichols	No, that was the Star Wars trek. [Some mechanical hands come out of her jar, pick up a video tape and put it in the VCR.] By the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had evolved from a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a full-blown religion.
	Priest	[on TV] And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble at all.
	Congregation	[chanting; on TV] All power to the engines.
	Nichols	As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders became threatened by the movements power. [In Berlin a sign is unveiled saying "Welcome To Nazi Planet Episode Land. Formerly Germany".] And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins.
	Man	[on TV] He's dead, Jim! [They throw another in.] He's dead, Jim! [Another.] He's dead, Jim!
	Nichols	Finally, the sacred texts were banned.
	George Takei	The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world, Omega 3, along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way.
	Nimoy	Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory.
	Bender	Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
	Zapp	I've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little about. Next witness.
	Kif	Bender the robot, please take the stand.
	Fry	She's all yours, buddy!
	Bender	I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.
	Zapp	Please use the beeps.
	Fry	Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned.
	Nimoy	I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
	Fry	You know. 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones.
	Nimoy	Oh, really, I've done too many things to remember one particular TV series. But if-if you want to discuss my books of poetry--
	Fry	Come on! Remember that episode where you go high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
	Nimoy	No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!
	Fry	Aha! You can't escape it!
	Nimoy	[crying] Oh, you're right, I can't.
	Fry	Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK, I outwitted you, but--
	Nimoy	[crying] No, it's my fellow cast members. 300 years ago they left Earth behind.
	Shatner	This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, Leonard.
	Nimoy	Bill, you are, and always shall be, my friend. But I just signed a six-month lease on my apartment. I can't walk away from a commitment like that.
	Shatner	Very well, my friend.
	Nimoy	[crying] Why did the world turn it's back on our obvious greatness?
	Fry	I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
	Nimoy	Oh!
	Frakes	Yes! Front row!
	Leela	You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you!
	Fry	But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
	Leela	But it's set 800 years in the past!
	Bender	Yeah, why is this so important to you?
	Fry	'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.
	Leela	Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.
	Bender	I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course.
	Leela	We're entering the Omega system.
	Computer Voice	Warning: You are now in forbidden space.
	Bender	Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? [sarcastic] Ooh, I'm so scared!
	Leela	I've lost control of the ship!
	Fry	Oh, dip!
	Nimoy	Dip, indeed!
	Fry	It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
	Nimoy	So many cardboard sets, so many memories. If only the others--
	Shatner	I guess that's my cue.
	Nimoy	Bill!
	Shatner	L-Dog!
	Nimoy	[laughing] Hey! This is wonderful!
	Shatner	Oh, man.
	Nimoy	I feel like hugging you.
	Shatner	Well I would except you have no body! [Nimoy laughs.] And we're both men.
	Nimoy	Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest! [A token redshirt steps out.] Welshie!
	Fry	Welshie?
	Nichols	We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200's but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodelling.
	George Takei	Ever since then, Welshie has been a welcome participant in our escapades.
	Fry	I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
	Shatner	We were on our way to Welshie's cousin's house to stay in the guest room when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed, just like yours.
	Koenig	When we woke up, we had these bodies.
	Fry	Say it in Russian!
	Koenig	Ven vee voke up vee had these wodies.
	Fry	Now say "nuclear wessels"!
	Koenig	No!
	George Takei	You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us, and we never age. Check out these abs!
	Bender	Yowza!
	Leela	But who's doing all this for you?
	Shatner	You know, we never thought about it. We're famous celebrities -- we're used to this sort of treatment.
	Melllvar	It is I!
	Bender	Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
	Melllvar	I am not an effect! You doubt my power?
	Bender	I do.
	Welshie	[shouting] Aye!
	Fry	[screaming] Welshie!
	Zapp	This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this court's ex-lover, Turanga Leela.
	Leela	Go [beep] yourself.
	Melllvar	Behold another power, different from the one you saw earlier.
	Nimoy	Hey, a body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is mine, alright!
	Fry	Alright, you gas, what's the deal?
	Melllvar	Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained down upon my planet. Over and over, I watched them. Especially the five with the energy beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, knower of the episodes! Tremble before my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!
	Fry	Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
	Melllvar	I beg to differ. [He zaps Welshie some more.] Long have I waited for the one who played Spock. At last, we can begin.
	Fry	Cool! A Star Trek convention!
	Nimoy	Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last?
	Melllvar	Until time stops.
	Leela	What?
	Shatner	He can't do this!
	Nimoy	You can't be serious!
	Melllvar	Now, we have a full schedule of events--
	Bender	Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?
	Koenig	Good question!
	Melllvar	No, you have to stay even longer.
	Melllvar	Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. "Melllvar" has three "L's".
	George Takei	I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell "Melllvar".
	Bender	Say "nerd"!
	All	Nerd!
	Shatner	[spoken-word] I'm Slim Shady,Yes, I'm the real Shady,All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating,So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,Please stand up,Please stand up.
	Koenig	How can you do a spoken-word version of a rap song?
	Melllvar	He found a way.
	Leela	For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
	Shatner	[shouting] Khaaan!
	Fry	Uh ... Khan?
	Leela	Correct.
	Melllvar	My button has broken. The trivia contest has ended. I-I now have a surprise. You will perform a fan script, written by the ultimate Trek fan.
	Fry	You have my fan script?
	Melllvar	I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate fan!
	Fry	[smug] Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different.
	Melllvar	Trivia contest over! Take your scripts! [The actors run to a pile of scripts.] We have limited rehearsal time. Now, I didn't make enough copies of the script, so George and Walter will have to share.
	Leela	Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending.
	Melllvar	That's right! The ending must not be ruined.
	Leela	We'll go wait in the ship.
	Melllvar	OK.
	Fry	Not till I get my 600 quatloos!
	Fry	This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
	Bender	I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
	Leela	I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?
	Fry	Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy.
	Leela	Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure.
	Bender	Like putting too much air in a balloon!
	Fry	Of course! It's so simple!
	Shatner	[reading] Alas, my ship, whom I love like a woman, is .. .disabled. [He slumps back in his chair and rolls his head.] Oh, Lord!
	Nimoy	[reading] Fascinating, Captain, and logical too. Yet we need some help.
	George Takei	[reading] Look, Captain, Melllvar will help us.
	Koenig	[reading] Keptin, I wope he will welp our ... vessel.
	Melllvar	Wessel! [Koenig shudders.] You're not acting hard enough!
	Nimoy	Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much.
	Shatner	And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me, because I respected me so much!
	Bender	[shouting] OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or whatever.
	Leela	Fire!
	Nichols	[reading] My, what a handsome energy creature you are. I love you. [The orange beams converge on Melllvar and he screams.] Hey, you wrote it!
	Leela	It's not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
	Fry	Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
	Bender	Yup!
	Leela	So, uh, how's rehearsal going?
	Melllvar	Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch of actors while you, a crew of genuine space heroes, risked your lives to save them.
	Nimoy	Hey! We've done heroic things too.
	Nichols	Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!
	Melllvar	Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option.
	Koenig	Keep them and let us go?
	Melllvar	No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat ... to the death!
	Bender	Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
	Melllvar	Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77.
	Fry	Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!
	Melllvar	I was getting to that one!
	Zapp	So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death. I assume no one survived.
	Leela	Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
	Melllvar	This will be your standard battle to the death. The only weapons: Whatever you can find. But I warn you, do nothing until I have signalled the start of combat. OK, start.
	Koenig	I don't have much experience at fighting -- except with you guys.
	Shatner	I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy?
	Nimoy	You mean Doohan?
	Shatner	Whoever it was, I did it like this.
	George Takei	Ow!
	Shatner	My foot's cold!
	Leela	There. We can make these into spears.
	Fry	And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
	Bender	And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw! [He pulls out a Tommy gun from behind a rock and expends the entire round. Fry and Leela glare at him and he chuckles.] That was fun!
	Nichols	What if I distract them with my famous fan dance?
	Shatner	Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a karate chop!
	George Takei	I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate. Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?
	Shatner	Well, no, but you never talk about yourself.
	George Takei	[sad] Maybe if you showed a little interest.
	Fry	Well, here goes nothing.
	Nichols	[sexfully] Hello, boys!
	Bender	Whoa!
	George Takei	Hi-yah!
	Shatner	There's no right way to hit a woman.
	Leela	Then do it the wrong way.
	Shatner	Fine. Yah!
	Leela	Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
	Shatner	See you in h--
	Bender	Come on, Walter!
	Nimoy	Take that!
	Fry	It hurts!
	Nimoy	Let's see if this actually works! [He tries to do the Vulcan neck pinch on Bender but it doesn't work.] Hm. [Bender punches him, grabs his legs and swings him around, whacking the others in the face.] Ow! Ow! Ow!
	Koenig	My face!
	George Takei	Ow! My face too!
	Shatner	May I? [Leela grabs him and throws him over her head.] Oh!
	Melllvar	Excellent! Excellent!
	Shatner	Leela, please. This is exactly what Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers. Can't we resolve our differences some other way?
	Melllvar's Mother	Melllvar! Dinner time!
	Melllvar	Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!
	Melllvar's Mother	Now!
	Fry	All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child.
	Melllvar's Mother	He's not a child, he's 34!
	Bender	Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!
	Fry	Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together.
	Shatner	I love you so much!
	Nimoy	Hello?
	Fry	We've decided to work together.
	Nimoy	Uh, so did they.
	Shatner	Now, how do we escape?
	Leela	We can't use our ship; we have life support but the engines are wrecked.
	George Takei	Ironic, because our engines work but our life support systems don't.
	Leela	Hey, if your engines work--
	George Takei	And your life support systems work--
	Fry	Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! [to himself] Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you.
	Leela	We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!
	Fry	Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?
	Nimoy	I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.
	Fry	We did it!
	Fry	Melllvar's got a spaceship!
	Melllvar	[on screen] Yes, in mint condition. And you made me take it out of the package!
	Leela	The Nimbus! We're saved!
	Zapp	[on screen] You're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded.
	Zapp	So I boarded you, eh? What happened next?
	Leela	You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!
	Leela	One more hit and we're done for!
	George Takei	Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like "destruct sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--"
	Bender	Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!
	Melllvar	[on screen] If I can't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!
	Fry	Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?
	Melllvar	[on screen] Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd do without them.
	Fry	Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor.
	Koenig	Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person, with my own friends and credit cards and keys.
	Melllvar	[on screen] Well, I guess I could move out of my parents' basement ... maybe get a temp job.
	Fry	Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.
	Melllvar	[on screen] I thank you, Fry. You know, you and I are of a kind. In a different reality I could have called you "friend".
	Fry	Episode 10, Balance of Terror.
	Melllvar	[on screen] More like episode nine, loser! In your face! Victory is mine!
	Shatner	I wonder, my friends, was he really such an evil energy gas?
	Nichols	He did give us eternal youth.
	Koenig	24-hour Laundromat.
	George Takei	A full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular.
	Nimoy	Truly, it was a paradise.
	Fry	And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
	Shatner	Let's get the hell outta here!
