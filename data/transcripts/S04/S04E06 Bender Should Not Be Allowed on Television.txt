	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] Previously on All My Circuits...
	Antonio	[crying; on TV] I'm sorry, Father. But, somewhere along the way, I forgot how to be your son.
	Calculon	[on TV] Why, Antonio?
	Antonio	[crying; on TV] Because ... I have amnesia!
	Monique	[on TV] Calculon? But I thought you were--
	Calculon	[on TV] Egyptian?
	Monique	[on TV] Before I kill you, I must ask you one question: Who am I? For I have ... amnesia!
	Calculon	[on TV] Let me get this straight: Does anyone here not have amnesia?
	Monique	[on TV] Not sure.
	Human Friend	[on TV] I 'unno.
	Cubert	This show is awesome! When I grow up I'm gonna have so much amnesia!
	Dwight	Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I forgot.
	Cubert	Well, mine's louder!
	Bender	Cram a ham in it, you twerps! [He throws his beer bottle at them, it misses and hits Fry, who squeals.] Sorry!
	Fry	Nah, I had it coming.
	Calculon	[on TV] Welcome, swingers. Pull up a groove and get fabulous.
	Monique	[on TV] Nude rocks bands, big piles of what I assume is talcum powder. It's quite a birthday party, Calculon.
	Cubert	Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday party just like Calculon!
	Dwight	Oh, yeah? Well I'm gonna show up looking good, just like Monique.
	Leela	Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?
	Cubert	Um, we're 12. So, yes.
	Dwight	Hold up, Cubert. You're a clone of the Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?
	Cubert	Um, duh!
	Dwight	"Duh" what?
	Cubert	Dad? Do I have a birthday?
	Professor Farnsworth	Hmm. You didn't have a birth so, technically, no. [Cubert sighs. Farnsworth puts his hand on his shoulder.] Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank, or the day I scraped your DNA from that growth on my back.
	Cubert	Ooh! That one!
	Professor Farnsworth	Ah, yes. It was 13 years ago next week. [He takes something out of his lab coat.] I used this very fork.
	Hermes	Aw, well isn't that-- Ew!
	Dwight	Hey! Next week'll be my birthday too.
	Hermes	That's true. If only there were a way to have one party for both of you here at the office then write it off as a business expense. Wait! I thought of a way! The way I just said!
	Cubert	Yeah!
	Dwight	Way to go, Pops!
	Bender	[shouting; from lounge] Something's happening on television.
	Calculon	[on TV] Oh, Monique, why did we wait so many years to bathe in champagne?
	Antonio	[on TV] Father, I've discovered the shocking secret mother has kept from you for 200 years.
	Monique	[on TV] No! No!
	Antonio	[on TV] Brace yourself. For when I speak these words, you may well suffer an attack of explosive amnesia. For you see, the horrible secret is--
	Bender	Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
	Sal	He's busteds. Let's get hims outta heres.
	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] We now join America's most popular show already in progress, Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.
	Fry	This show's been going downhill since season three.
	Zoidberg	Look who's here, everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!
	Leela	Since when are you performing at children's parties?
	Zoidberg	Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes--
	Dwight	This party pukes.
	Cubert	Yeah! The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago.
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, that doesn't mean that no one is coming or that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?
	Dwight	Alright! They must have all come as a group.
	Cubert	Welcome, swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous.
	Tinny Tim	Good day, fellows. Someone dumped this invitation in my begging cup. Happy growth-scraping day to all!
	Hermes	Fire 'em all.
	Professor Farnsworth	Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
	Bender	[gasping] Guys! Guys! Something's happening on television again.
	Morbo	[on TV] Welcome to Entertainment And Earth Invasion Tonite. Across the galaxy, my people are completing the mighty space fleet that will exterminate the human race! But first, this news from Tinseltown.
	Linda	[on TV] Following Antonio Calculon Jr.'s breakdown on the set, the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call for child robots to replace him.
	Bender	An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
	Tinny Tim	What's that, sir?
	Bender	That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!
	Tinny Tim	You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly, sir. [He raises his crutch.] Bravo!
	Leela	Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here.
	Fry	Look! There's Macaulay Culkon.
	Leela	He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
	Fry	Pst. There's that robot child actor who grew up and robbed a convenience store!
	Leela	And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!
	Robber-bot	Lottery ticket, please.
	Casting Director	We're ready for the first audition. [She looks at her clipboard.] [reading] Emotitron Jr.?
	Mombot	Hold on, precious. Let's make you look nice for the lady. [She smoothes his "hair" down and opens his chest cabinet, revealing wires.] What's this? [She snaps the wires out.] What did I tell you? [She whips him with every word.] No more hanging wires!
	Casting Director	In this scene, you've just found out your real father is Calculon's fourth evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. OK ... take us there!
	Emotitron Jr.	Now that I know the truth, Father, I must ride south and join the robo-bandidos at Veracruz.
	Bender	[shouting; from outside] Awful! Boo! This kid sucks! We want Bender! Boo!
	Calculon	Well, I thought he was good but the audience seems to have turned on him.
	Casting Director	But I don't think--
	Calculon	Next!
	Macaulay Culkon	--At Veracruz. So, if you'll kindly hand me my poncho--
	Bender	[shouting; from outside] Boo! Bring on Bender! Boo! Bender's the greatest!
	Calculon	Sorry, kid. You're flailing up there. [He screams and runs out.] 90 actors and they all got boo-ed. I just wish we could get this Bender I keep hearing about. They say he's the greatest.
	Casting Director	Well, there is a robot named Bender here but he's much too old for--
	Calculon	Send him in forthwith!
	Bender	[shouting] Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
	Casting Director	Mr. Bender?
	Casting Director	Have you ever been on TV before?
	Bender	Once, when I took those hostages.
	Calculon	I saw that! You were good. Let's hear you audition.
	Bender	Bandidos, eh? Aw, this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent! [He clears his throat.] [bad Spanish accent] I will see. Adios Padre! Come, Jesus, my faithful ... chee-huey-hua. Tonight we eat ... gee-wack-a-mole by the El Rio!
	Calculon	That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are. You will never work on my show!
	Fry	[shouting; from outside] Yay, Bender!
	Leela	[shouting; from outside] We demand Bender!
	Calculon	However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard, son!
	Bender	Father-o!
	Calculon	Bender, I'd like you to meet our director ... [He pulls a man with a ponytail and wearing a blernsball cap in front of him.] ... whose name I never learned.
	Bender	Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
	Director	Uh, don't worry about the script, baby. We re-wrote your part to better suit your acting abilities.
	Bender	So now my character has a British accent?
	Director	No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move. [He moves off the set behind the cameras. Bender grumbles and hops onto the bed and lies down.] And ... action!
	Bender	[muttering] Stupid dumb coma ... coulda been British.
	Calculon	Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent ... coma.
	Bender	[quietly] Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
	Calculon	Curse the tragic wildebeest accident that--
	Bender	Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me "Bender"! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut. [He stands up on the bed and starts dancing.] C'mon, baby! [He hums and takes a cigar out of his chest cabinet and takes a few puffs then follows with a gulp of beer.] Come on!
	Calculon	I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
	Bender	Bite my shiny metal ass! [He carries on dancing.] Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
	Director	[shouting] Cut! [He walks onto the set.] That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. We'll have to shoot it again.
	Calculon	No! No, no, no. I don't do two takes.
	Director	But this guy was--
	Calculon	Amateurs like you do two takes. I do one take. Print it. I'll be in my three-storey trailer.
	Bender	[on TV] Bite my shiny metal ass! [He starts dancing.] Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
	Bender	Now that's hospital dancing. [He nudges Calculon.] Pretty good, eh, Calcky?
	Calculon	Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies. [On the screen Bender whistles nonchalantly as he empties a chest of drawers.] I don't even remember shooting this scene.
	Director	We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room.
	Calculon	He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious ham!
	Director	The network Execubots are coming!
	Calculon	Oh, dear God!
	Betabot	Presenting the president of the network.
	Network President	Greetings, gentlemen. You already know my Execubots: Executive Alpha, programmed to like things it has seen before.
	Alphabot	Hey, hey, hey.
	Network President	Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule.
	Betabot	More reality shows.
	Network President	And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate middle America.
	Gammabot	It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?
	Network President	Now, who put this obnoxious, dancing robot on my network?
	Director	We were about to fire him, sir.
	Network President	Silence, hack! We've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully. And during the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, viewer eyeball focus was up 90%.
	Calculon	But, sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth monger!
	Network President	At our network, we love filth! Filthy rich, that is! Being filthy rich, that is! [He laughs and signals fizzle towards the Execubots, making them all laugh with him.] "Bite my shiny metal ass" could be a catchphrase.
	Alphabot	80% likely.
	Gammabot	It will play in Peoria.
	Betabot	Gameshows are back.
	Network President	We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network. Bender? Can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on TV?
	Bender	Yes, I can.
	Tinny Tim	Yeah! Shooting!
	Dwight	Alright!
	Dwight	Yo! Check out what I jacked from my dad.
	Cubert	A cigar!
	Tinny Tim	Ripping!
	Dwight	Look! I'm Bender!
	Hermes	Ras H. Tafari! What's goin' on here?
	Professor Farnsworth	The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
	Hermes	That's not a cigar. Uh ... and it's not mine!
	Cubert	Hey, Dad! Bite my shiny metal ass!
	Professor Farnsworth	What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?
	Tinny Tim	From Bender, my good jerkwad.
	Hermes	Bender, eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads.
	Bender	OK, OK, OK. Get ready for this part.
	Zoidberg	Quiet, robot! Bender's on TV.
	Monique	[on TV] Oh, Calculon, it's so good to get away from the city and that beastly, yet intriguing, Bender.
	Bender	[on TV] Try this, kids at home!
	Linda	[on TV] Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth children?
	Bender	That's crazy!
	Linda	[on TV] A new protest group, Fathers Against Rude Television, says "Hell, yes!"
	Fry	Pft! What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
	Zoidberg	That was uncanny.
	Hermes	Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high-definition filth.
	Professor Farnsworth	And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
	Hermes	No, sir! Not us FARTers.
	Bender	Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.
	Leela	As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
	Fry	Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
	Cubert	Our dads are all pumped up on dork-osterone. We're just trying to be cool, like Bender.
	Dwight	Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf.
	Tinny Tim	Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate Bender without barfing. We could commit a burglary.
	Dwight	Hey, yeah!
	Cubert	Bender loves to burgle!
	Dwight	Hold up, though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff.
	Cubert	Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel: Bender!
	Dwight	Whoa!
	Tinny Tim	We'll rob Bender!
	Dwight	TV gave us the idea.
	Bender	[voice-over] You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery.
	Cubert	OK. It's crime time.
	Fry	Hey, Bender. [Cubert walks past with a Bender portrait.] Hey, Bender. [Dwight struggles with a safe marked "Bender's Loot".] Hey, Bender. [The phone rings. Fry picks up.] Hey, Bender.
	Professor Farnsworth	What's going on in here? [The music stops. Hermes rubs some dirt off Farnsworth's glasses and Farnsworth straightens them.] Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
	Hermes	Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?
	Zoidberg	I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
	Cubert	Relax, Dad. We just invited a few friends over.
	Professor Farnsworth	Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it. [He gasps.] Of course! You don't have friends!
	Hermes	Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
	Dwight	Um ... we're just cool, is all!
	Professor Farnsworth	Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!
	Cool-o-Meter	Oh, yeah!
	Professor Farnsworth	Good Lord! I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies.
	Hermes	Everybody out!
	Zoidberg	So, do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party.
	Hermes	There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come from?
	Tinny Tim	Don't tell, comrades. All for one and one for all!
	Dwight	We stole it!
	Tinny Tim	Oh, crumb!
	Bender	What? What's going on?
	Professor Farnsworth	I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
	Hermes	And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk.
	Bender	Hey, lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when-- Hey! This is my stuff they stole! [He takes Playbot from Tinny Tim.] That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!
	Bender	Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? [The dads cheer.] Come on! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats!
	FART Mob	[chanting] Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
	Bender	This mob's with me.
	Security Guard	Go ahead.
	FART Mob	[chanting] Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with-- [They see a red light and a "Quiet When Red Light Is On" sign outside the Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad soundstage and stop chanting. The light goes off and they carry on.] Bender! Down with Bender!
	Calculon	As a doctor and captain of this hospital ship, I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live.
	Professor Farnsworth	Listen up, Hollywood. We're an exciting, new mob.
	Bender	Yeah!
	Hermes	You'd better believe it!
	Calculon	Great Shatner's ghost!
	Bender	We demand that all TV's be equipped with a B-Chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
	Professor Farnsworth	Booya!
	Network President	I'm afraid the answer is a gritty, in-your-face no.
	Bender	Then I quit.
	Network President	Then you don't quit. [His CD-ROM drive opens and one of the Execubots puts a gun in it and connects it to him.] I think you'll be finishing the scene now, Mr. Bender. And don't skimp on the nasty.
	Professor Farnsworth	There'll be no further nasty. [He takes a laser out of his lab coat.] We still have the option of resorting to violence.
	Hermes	What makes you think that'll work?
	Professor Farnsworth	I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon. How cool was that?
	Bender	Ooh, yeah! C'mon--
	Professor Farnsworth	Quit the show!
	Network President	Do the scene.
	Professor Farnsworth	I'm a cold-blooded punk!
	Network President	I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it.
	Bender	Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!
	Network President	Really?
	Professor Farnsworth	Wha?
	Bender	Aha!
	Professor Farnsworth	I was using that!
	Bender	Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.
	Director	You're angry.
	Bender	Perfect. [He turns to the camera.] Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do. [He blows some cigar smoke.] How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is "yes". But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not! [He accidentally fires Farnsworth's laser and a laser bolt flies over Farnsworth's head, narrowly missing him. Bender clears his throat.] Uh ... on the other hand, most, perhaps all the blame, rests with the parents. That's right, you! [He points his firearms at the FART mob and they gasp and duck.] And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
	Hermes	[ashamed] We're just so busy.
	Bender	Well make time.
	Director	And ... cut!
	Calculon	Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air.
	Bender	[on TV] : Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
	Hermes	Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there.
	Cubert	What was it?
	Professor Farnsworth	Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while.
	Fry	Hear, hear!
	Leela	Yeah!
	Bender	Damn right!
	Dwight	So, should we turn it off now?
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, uh, that depends what's on.
	Fry	Nothing good.
	Professor Farnsworth	Ah, let's just keep watching.
	Bender	[singing] TV party tonight!
	Professor Farnsworth	Wha?
	Bender	[singing] TV party tonight!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh!
	Fry	[singing] We've got nothing better to do.
	Leela	[singing] Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
	Zoidberg	[singing] Don't wanna talk about anything else.
	Fry	[singing] We don't wanna know!
	Professor Farnsworth	[singing] We're dedicated, yes!
	Hermes	[singing] To our favourite shows!
	Cubert	All My Circuits
	Dwight	Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad!
	Amy	Scary Door!
	Leela	Blernsday Night Blernsball!
	Bender	Futurama!
