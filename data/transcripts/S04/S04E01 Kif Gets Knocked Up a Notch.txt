	Amy	Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega-sweet for party-boarding.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Indeed.
	Amy	Any calls while I was out?
	Leela	Yeah. You got a tele-sonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
	Amy	My Kiffie called? [She walks over to the screen. Kif is still on the line, drumming his fingers on the desk in front of him.] Kif?
	Kif	[on screen] Ooh, Amy, you're back. Another hour and I would have thought about hanging up.
	Amy	Why didn't you just leave a message, sweetie?
	Kif	[on screen] Well, um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to get them.
	Amy	[shouting] Bender!
	Bender	Not my fault if you don't check me! [He pushes his flashing antenna down and a tape inside him rewinds.] Messages erased.
	Kif	[on screen] Oh, dearest, this long-distance relationship is too much to bear. [Zapp walks behind him, just about wearing a towel. He hums and rubs the towel between his legs.] When even an inch separates us, I quiver with misery. So you can imagine how I feel when it's a billion light years.
	Amy	[on screen] Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache.
	Zapp	[on screen] Lieutenant, some things came off me and clogged the drain, so if you could-- Oh, ho! What's this?
	Zapp	Well, well, well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosom-y swan, Leela?
	Leela	[on screen] Say again. You're breaking up!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7.
	Scruffy	Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!
	Amy	You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there. You could drop me off on the way.
	Prof. Farnsworth	We could but we won't! It's a spaceship, damnit, not a prom limousine! [He growls.] If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.
	Leela	This is a very long trip. So we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen.
	Bender	[muttering] I don't even breathe oxygen!
	Amy	[whispering] Here I come, Kif!
	Zapp	They jumped right out of their pants! [A klaxon goes off and the message "Approaching Vessel: Collision Imminent" appears on several screens.] Oh, what now? Activate glass window. [Kif lifts the projection screen up. The Planet Express ship flies towards them. Kif gasps.] Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy!
	Kif	Yes, sir, captain!
	Zapp	How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?
	Leela	OK. I was just at this part: Yah!
	Zapp	Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!
	Kif	Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licensed starship! Oh, it's so romantic it gives me the shivers!
	Amy	I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lipless beak.
	Kif	Oh, Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot about this and, well, would you move in with me?
	Amy	Here? But, uh, wouldn't it be crowded?
	Kif	No, no! It's really twice the size. You can use the floor and I'll have the ceiling. See?
	Amy	Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but I'm not ... [Kif falls from the ceiling.] ... sure if I--
	Kif	Hush! Before you answer, come thither.
	Kif	This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing can hurt you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real.
	Amy	Well, that probably won't happen this time.
	Kif	I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer: Run program "Kif 1".
	Amy	This is so beautiful! [A pony gallops by.] Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already.
	Kif	Yes, I programmed it in for you. 4 million lines of BASIC! And if this isn't the life you want, how 'bout this? Run program "Kif 2".
	Amy	Oh, Kif!
	Kif	We could live here at the shore of the Tranquilibrius Sea in a timeshare. And I would pluck the moon from the sky just to see you smile. [He reaches up to the moon and tries to pull it down. He struggles. It starts to glide away from the shore, pulling him over the water.] Almost got it. It seems to be ... sort of ... stuck! [He falls into the water.] I love you! [The moon falls and hits him on the head. He splutters.] Run program "Kif://3".
	Amy	This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
	Kif	Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together, it'll feel like a castle to me.
	Amy	Kif, I'd love to live with you ... someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna do on my own. [The Holo-Shed crackles around them.] What was that?
	Kif	Oh, dear. I fear the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross paths with Attila the--
	Amy	Look! Spirit!
	Kif	And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack the Ripper, Evil Lincoln!
	Moriarty	Right-oh, gents, it's another simulation gone mad, so murder and mayhem, standard procedure!
	Jack the Ripper	Rampage!
	Evil Lincoln	[shouting] Real holographic-simulated Evil Lincoln is back!
	Kif	The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again! The characters turned real!
	Zapp	Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity suits. [The holograms run in and everyone screams.] Listen up, history's greatest villains... [He holds up a large gun.] Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting!
	Attila the Hun	Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
	Zapp	Spare me your space-age techno-babble, Attila the Hun!
	Bender	Hey!
	Amy	Kif! Hold on!
	Kif	I totally want to!
	Leela	Grab on!
	Fry	Over here!
	Kif	Please hold me!
	Bender	Have a good one! [He flies towards the hole. The holographic Moon bounces in, bounces across the bridge and plugs the hole. The wind stops and everyone hits the floor.] Oh, man!
	Zapp	After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
	McGee	Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal haemorrhaging and a partially barfed-up heart, everyone appears fine. [Everyone breathes sighs of relief.] Oh, and Kif is pregnant.
	Kif	Oh, joy!
	Kif	Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!
	Amy	Yes it's ... great. A great miracle.
	Leela	And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
	Bender	Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im! [He goes for Kif and everyone restrains him.] Come over here, Kif! You--
	Zapp	Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant. So, Kif, pray explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate.
	Kif	Well, it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love we enter a so-called "receptive state".
	Zapp	You disgust me! Go on.
	Kif	At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane, which allows the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voil√†.
	Bender	Well, OK. But that better be all there is!
	Kif	Oh, Amy! You'll be a mother!
	Kif	What a wondrous affirmation of our love. And all from the touch of your hand.
	Fry	Dude, hold up. Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
	Evil Lincoln	Indeed.
	Fry	Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
	Amy	Hey, yeah! I mean ... what about that, Kif?
	Kif	Well, I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat. Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom.
	Zapp	Ah, my home away from home. By the way, Kif, your flush seemed to be set on stun, not kill.
	Amy	Look, Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course, I hope I am. But just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test.
	Bender	A test! I demand a test!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-species genetic analyser. But I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber. [Fry, Leela, Amy and Zapp walk into it.] Now to take a DNA sample. [He draws some liquid from Kif, making him deflate, then puts the liquid in a part of the machine.] When I pull this switch, the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, separating out everyone who isn't the mother-- Father-- Whatever!
	Bender	Faster! Faster!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom. [Zapp comes through the tube, gets stuck halfway and finally flies out and lands on Fry.] Nor is Captain Brannigan.
	Kif	Oh, thank you, merciful God!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Zoidberg? What the hell were you doing in there?
	Zoidberg	That's where I live. I have no home.
	Kif	Amy? But that means--
	Kif	Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class: "No Glove, No Love".
	Leela	Wow, this is all so confusing.
	Zapp	Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this? [crying] Stop testing our love!
	Kif	Please, Captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but, in my species, the true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the "smizmar". And my smizmar is Amy.
	Zapp	So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?
	Leela	Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
	Amy	That's OK. At least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar. [She presses her wrist machine and a calendar comes up in front of her.] Thursday: Baby shower, enter. [The calendar enters it in on Thursday the 4th.] Might as well plan for my new life while I'm at it. Set "Motherhood Mode".
	Leela	To motherhood.
	Bender	Zoidberg?
	Fry	You know, my face was stuck in a pizza.
	Amy	Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but--
	Mrs. Wong	Yeah, yeah. We don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is that we have grandchild now.
	Kif	You're very open-minded, Mrs. Wong.
	Mr. Wong	Hey! You call her "Grandma" now!
	Mrs. Wong	Call me Grandma like crazy! All the time!
	Fry	Check it out, y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
	Zoidberg	Also Zoidberg!
	Fry	So let's open the gifts.
	Bender	Alright!
	Kif	I can't wait! Let's start with this one, from Bender.
	Bender	It's my booties from when I was a kid.
	Amy	Uh, they're already bronzed.
	Bender	They are bronze.
	Kif	And this one's from Leela. Oh, I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!
	Zapp	Yes, I wonder what we got you.
	Kif	It's a basket! F-For picnics?
	Leela	It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the orphanarium.
	Hermes	You could use it for picnics.
	Mrs. Wong	Here, Amy. We get this one for you.
	Amy	Is it a new party board?
	Mrs. Wong	It's a board alright! An ironing board.
	Mr. Wong	We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore.
	Amy	You-You trashed my party board?
	Mrs. Wong	Damn right! Now you're a mom, the only surfing you do is under a big wave of responsibility.
	Kif	Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts. But the greatest gift--
	Bender	Mine!
	Kif	Is the bond I share with my smizmar, Amy. For soon, the quivering mass of life within me will depend on us both. [He rubs his bump.] Even now, I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing. And shortly, it will rend my loins in twain, burst forth and pull us down, down, down into the deep, dark waters of commitment.
	Zoidberg	That's so beautiful!
	Amy	[crying] Yes, it's, it's-- [She shakes her head.] No! I can't do this!
	Bender	Oh, my God!
	Kif	Oh, how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibility for the children they've helped create? [His bump rumbles and he gasps.] The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites.
	Scruffy	Lemme know how that turns out.
	Kif	I must now embark on a perilous journey to give birth in precisely the same swamp in which I was born.
	Leela	If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.
	Kif	No, Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar. And since Amy isn't, here I must go it alone. Farewell, for we may never meet again.
	Kif	My scrapes feel a little better now.
	Bender	Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!
	Kif	It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
	Bender	I'm back, baby!
	Kif	Behold! The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.
	Zapp	Smells like a jockstrap!
	Grand Midwife	I am the Grand Midwife.
	Fry	Hi!
	Kif	I am Kif, of the clan Kroker, come to bear my young.
	Grand Midwife	Then let the Tea of New Life be brewed. [She points to a large jug with a tea bag string hanging out of it.] As it is writ, "and both shall lift the jug together". Where is your smizmar?
	Kif	She's not with me.
	Grand Midwife	Oh, the sorrow. Oh, the shame. I'm sorry, I'm probably just making you feel worse.
	Kif	As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two. [He tries to lift the jug but struggles. Zapp shakes his head in disappointment.] Apparently Amy hasn't been working out much lately.
	Grand Midwife	As the tea boils, please join hands with your beloved smizmar. [Kif looks away.] Oh, right, sorry. But I memorised the ceremony by rote and it mentions her a lot.
	Kif	I'll try to endure.
	Grand Midwife	Good, 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's eyes.
	Bender	What are you looking at?
	Grand Midwife	May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both through all your days. [Kif cries. The Midwife ladles some tea into a cup.] The Tea of New Life is ready. Let those whose love created this life speak each other's names, then drink.
	Kif	[quietly] Amy.
	Amy	[shouting] Kif!
	Kif	Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with loneliness?
	Bender	Both.
	Amy	I still don't know if I'm ready for this but I do know I love you. And I wanna be here beside you.
	Grand Midwife	Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!
	Kif	Oh, no time! It has begun! [He and Amy gulp back some of the tea and Kif falls back into the Midwife's arms. Amy holds his head and he groans.] Oh, my!
	Bender	Neat!
	Amy	You can do it, Kif!
	Kif	Whoa, Nellie!
	Bender	Oh, man!
	Kif	Amy, my love, tell me: Are they making it to the water?
	Leela	Amy!
	Amy	Shoo! Stay away from my babies!
	Grand Midwife	The birthing is complete!
	Bender	Alright!
	Kif	Oh, thank goodness!
	Grand Midwife	I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere, but you don't have to talk to me anymore.
	Fry	Congratulations!
	Zapp	Nice work!
	Bender	Way to go, squishy!
	Leela	There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
	Fry	That's birth for you.
	Kif	Well, we've given them a great start, Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children.
	Amy	I'll be ready then.
