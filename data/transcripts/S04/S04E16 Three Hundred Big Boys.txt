	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] This week in the universe. [The scene on the TV changes to a planet where DOOP soldiers battle giant spiders.] Dateline, Turantulon 6: The brave warriors of Earth, under the command of General Major Webelo Zapp Brannigan, have achieved victory over the spider homeworld. [Kif hits two spiders with a giant fly swat and Zapp runs him over in a Jeep.] And to the victor belong the spoils; one trillion dollars in silken treasure.
	Zapp	[on TV] Mmm!
	Richard Nixon	[on TV] My fellow Earthicans, after meeting with top voodoo economists, I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you each 300 buckaroos in the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill. Knock yourselves out!
	Zoidberg	Money!
	Amy	I'm slightly richer!
	Bender	What to do, what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?
	Leela	I'm going to swim with a whale. They're the gentle giants of the deep.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm well aware of that.
	Scruffy	Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts. This one's lost its pizzazz!
	Zoidberg	A fortune, it is! At last Zoidberg will live like a rich man!
	Richard Nixon	[on bill] Hey, cut it out! Go away! Get away!
	Amy	Shmeesh! It's just 300 bucks. What is that, like a hundred cups of coffee?
	Fry	That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee. Starting now. [He walks over to the coffee machine.] Coffee machine, one cup of coffee, please.
	Richard Nixon	[on bill] Smells good!
	Zapp	[on screen] Leela? Are you there?
	Leela	No.
	Zapp	[on screen] Oh, yes, you are! I'm hereby inviting you and your oddball co-workers to a special reception to display the national silk surplus. I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it. Show them my medal, Kif.
	Kif	[on screen] He rented it with his tax refund.
	Zapp	[on screen] So, Leela, will you have the pleasure?
	Leela	What little there is to be had.
	Zapp	[on screen] Tomorrow night at eight them. Smooches!
	Crack Addict	No cheap crack houses for me no more!
	Man #1	Very good, sir. Shall I pre-warm sir's crack pipe?
	Amy	Oh, Kif, it was so romantic of you to rent this paddle plane with your tax rebate. We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze.
	Kif	[gasping] Yes. Seeds ... wafting.
	Amy	I almost feel kinda shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo!
	Tattoo #1	Hey, Gordon Gecko! I cost as much as this whole crummy date!
	Amy	Shut up! [She slaps her arm.] Ow!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Uh, ma'am, it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?
	Geneworks Woman	Well, yes. In the same way an infant may fight Muhammad Ali. But--
	Prof. Farnsworth	One pound of stem cells, please.
	Geneworks Woman	Of course, any age-reversing effects will be purely temporary.
	Bender	Say, buddy, why's this Grand Cigar so pricey?
	Clerk	Well, as you can see, its wrapper is a piece of the original US Constitution. It was hand-rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms-- Uh, well you know the rest.
	Bender	Give you 300 bucks for it.
	Clerk	No can do.
	Bender	Oh, alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then.
	Clerk	Very good, sir.
	Bender	So, uh, what time d'you close tonight?
	Dwight	Hey, Pops! Did that tax rebate come?
	Hermes	Came and went! You're now the proud owner of Bamboo Boogie Boots. [Dwight's smile fades.] With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun.
	Dwight	But, Pops, I don't wanna have fun. I wanna be like you; boring but prudently invested.
	Hermes	Babylon's bells! I tallied almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product. Now you put 'em on and have fun.
	Dwight	[shouting] I don't wanna!
	Hermes	Well then I'm gonna put 'em on and make you watch me have fun. [He sits on the steps, puts the boots on, stands up and smiles.] See? Fun! Fun-- [The bamboo comes out of the bottom of the boots and lifts Hermes into the air. He screams.] Dwight! Help me!
	Dwight	I'll save you, Pops!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hey! Turn that damn music-- [A woman looks up at him] Up!
	Hermes	Isn't this fun?
	Dwight	No! I wish I had two mommies!
	Randy Munchnik	Try these, uh, sir.
	Zoidberg	I ask for rich guy stuff and you give me shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu.
	Randy Munchnik	Ow!
	Leela	I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu, please.
	Whale Biologist	Well you asked the right guy. I'm the whale biologist. Though personally I hate whales. [whispering] Especially Mushu.
	Leela	Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
	Whale Biologist	I don't know you well enough to get into that. $300, please. [Leela hands him her $300 and he hands her a card.] Noon tomorrow. If you're late you only get to tread water in the scallop tank.
	Fry	Uh, I'll have a coffee.
	Man #2	Guppy, trout, mermaid or--
	Fry	Whale, please.
	Kif	[gasping] Amy, I-I also spent some of my tax rebate on a gift for you.
	Amy	Oh, Kiffie!
	Kif	It shows the time wherever we both are. And it's powered by love! Also, you have to wind it.
	Tattoo #1	Oh! Somebody won big at Skeeball!
	Amy	You shut up! I love it, Kif. I'll use it whenever I wanna know what time it is. [She kisses and hugs him. She looks down and sees Fry and Leela sat at a table.] Ooh! It's Fry and Leela! [shouting] Hi, Fry and Leela!
	Kif	Oh! Keep peddling! Oh, for the love of God, keep peddling!
	Amy	[shouting] Bye, Fry and Leela!
	Tattoo #1	Oh, I can't wait until the tattoos on Amy's butt hear about this!
	Tattoo #2	Hear about what?
	Tattoo #3	Tell us!
	Amy	Don't feel sad, my little tadpole.
	Kif	[crying] I'm trying not to. But my gift to you is in the belly of a whale.
	Zoidberg	Say, this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you.
	Amy	Hey, it is kinda like that.
	Zoidberg	To induce vomiting, that was the solution. Everywhere it went! [He chuckles.] What a Valentine's Day that was!
	Leela	Hmm. This may seem like a huge coincidence, but I happen to have an in with that whale.
	Scruffy	Scruffy's formulated a plan, but you'll need a ready source of nauseatin' rotten fish.
	Elzar	Freshen your coffee, sir?
	Fry	Yeah, yeah, yeah! Keep it coming! Put the pot down! Get away!
	Woman	You're so young in spirit. It's hard to believe you're as old as 25.
	Prof. Farnsworth	The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last.
	Elzar	What'll it be, kids?
	Prof. Farnsworth	One bowl of mild farina.
	Leela	Pay dirt! [She closes the door and pulls the plug out of the socket.] Hi-yah!
	Elzar	Here you go, big spender. Foie gras and caviar.
	Zoidberg	Goose liver? Fish eggs? [He eats it and spits it out.] Pah! Where's the goose? Where's the fish?
	Elzar	Hey, that's what rich people eat. The garbage parts of the food.
	Zoidberg	I ate garbage yesterday and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying. [He puts on a top hat.] Farewell, good sir!
	Bender	Le Grand Cigar! She is mine! And with absolutely no consequences.
	Smitty	You see that?
	URL	Grand theft tobacco. Time to get off our fat, cop asses and ride!
	Elzar	Pee-yew! This fish is slightly too rotten to even make jambalaya.
	Amy	[whispering] So far, so good. Where's Kif?
	Fry	[shouting] This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi! [He spits it out.] And the cup's shaking! I don't want my coffee shaking!
	Bender	You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy. Real greasy! You been up all night?
	Fry	Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffeine. It was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need a nap. [He goes to sleep for less than a second and wakes up and grabs a cup of coffee.] Coffee time!
	Bender	Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
	Fry	Fancy cigar. Why don't you smoke it already? Puff, puff! Go, go, go, go, go!
	Bender	Nah, you can't blow the smoke from such a majestic stogie in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy-pantses at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?
	Whale Biologist	And the fifth reason whales kill is for the sheer fun of it.
	Leela	Anything else?
	Whale Biologist	Yeah. You're lumpy and you smell awful. [Leela glares.] Hey, I calls 'em like I sees 'em! I'm a whale biologist.
	Leela	OK, Mushu, it's feeding time! [She dives in, not stopping to look at the "Please Do Not Feed The Whale" sign. Chewing sounds come from beneath the water and Leela comes up at the side of the tank gasping for air and not wearing her swimming costume.] Oh, crud! He ate my suit.
	Whale Biologist	The suit was ugly. Whale biologist!
	Caddy	Perhaps if you tightened your grip, sir?
	Zoidberg	Ah! Thank you, golf slave. [He tightens his grip and cuts through the golf club.] Bah! Rich people wouldn't waste their time on this nonsense. Plus, these eggs are gritty and tasteless.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ow! Not so rough!
	Whale Biologist	Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Mushu, the educated whale who thinks he's better than you.
	Amy	C'mon, Mushu! Barf! Barf like a freshman!
	Whale Biologist	And now, ignorant whale lovers, we'll see who's boss as I make Mushu jump through this hoop. Jump, Mushu! [Mushu jumps but he is so sick that he has to stop halfway through the ring.] Who wants a fish?
	Sam	Mushu is sad!
	URL	It just keeps comin' and comin'.
	Kif	Wait! That chunk. It's the watch! [Kif runs down the bleachers and dives into the water. The crowd cheers. He comes up in the middle of the vomit holding the watch.] I got it, Amy! I got it! The plan went off without a--
	Whale Biologist	He's got aquarium property! Stop him!
	URL	Better do what he says. He's a whale biologist.
	Smitty	You're under arrest, you squishy punk!
	Zapp	The Spiderians, though weak and woman-like on the battlefield, are masters of the textile arts. Taste like king crab, by the way. Crazy bugs actually wove this tapestry of my heroic conquest while I was still killing them.
	Zoidberg	What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's good, I'll buy it. [He waves his $300 around.] One art, please!
	Mom	What a clever impersonation of a stupid, poor person. How much is that placemat actually worth, Brannigan?
	Zapp	Exactly $1 billion.
	Mom	Now that's walking-around money!
	Richard Nixon	[on bill] What? Hey! Wait! Aroo!
	Whitey	So I said to Kitty, "The only way to keep the butler from running away is to cut off his foot." [Bender chuckles unenthusiastically and lights his cigar.] Yes, it reminds me of a joke I heard about upper-middle-class people.
	Amy	[crying] I've never been sad at a party before. I wonder if my mind is thinking about Kif being in jail.
	Scruffy	Jail's not so bad. You can make sangria in the terlet. Course, it's shank or be shanked.
	Amy	[crying] Of course.
	Whale Biologist	Look, just give back our property and we'll drop the charges.
	Kif	Fine, have the watch. It's broken anyway.
	Whale Biologist	I don't want your watch. You're covered in precious ambergris.
	Kif	Precious ... hamburgers?
	Holo-Roseanne	Ambergris. Noun. A grease-like product of the sperm whales digestive tract that is used as a base in the finest perfumes. This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts.
	Whale Biologist	You heard Roseanne. Scrape off the priceless ambergris and I'll let you go.
	Kif	Or-Or better yet, I'll simply shed my skin.
	Morbo	Stop it! Stop it! It's fine! I will destroy you!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wha? [His stem cells start to come away from his skin and his gasps. His hands go wrinkly, his hairline recedes, his face goes floppy and his ears go hairy.] Uh, gotta go. Uh, fight club!
	Woman	What's happening, Hubie?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk I bought with my tax refund.
	Woman	Well as long as we're being honest, I also spent my tax refund on a crazy treatment.
	Prof. Farnsworth	That certainly is honest.
	Woman	It's better for us to both just be ourselves. You, wrinkled as a prune.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You, fat as the queen of sea cows.
	Woman	I love you!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, my!
	Kif	So, you see, the putrid, waxy substance I was coated with was--
	Amy	Not precious ambergris!
	Kif	Yes! And I managed to sneak some out in the usual place. Ta-da! [He hands it to Amy.] Using that, I'll make you a perfume of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry.
	Amy	Oh, Kif, it's so romantic I can't even wait! I'm gonna wear it right now.
	Mom	Who smells like freaking porpoise hork?
	Amy	I do! Kiss me, Kif!
	Zoidberg	[crying] Oh, what a foolish squid I've been. I'm not rich. I can't even buy one measly masterpiece.
	Gus	Pardon us, gent. Might a couple of hungry, hungry hobos take a feed from that aluminum snack box?
	Zoidberg	So now I'm in the gutter, surrounded by bums who eat garbage? Money brought me no happiness. Bupkiss!
	Dandy Jim	Ooh! This boot's got a little pudding at the bottom.
	Ben Beeler	Interestingly, the Spiderians are more closely related to our elephants than our spiders.
	Hermes	[shouting] Don't mind us!
	Richard Nixon	The loot! The loot! The loot is on fire!
	Zapp	Leela, my precious rock tub. I'll save you!
	Kif	Everyone! To the fire door!
	Leela	It's on fire!
	Prof. Farnsworth	We're trapped, my sweet hippopotamus!
	Fry	Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee!
	Dwight	Where are we, Pops?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wha?
	Woman	What happened to the food?
	Leela	I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.
	Zoidberg	Welcome, one and all. I finally figured out how money could make me happy. By using it to buy my hungry friends a feast.
	Dandy Jim	Everyone join us. Oysters Rockefeller here has provided genuine turkey dogs!
	Whitey	Heck, you're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog.
	Amy	Yeah!
	Bender	Alright! Turkey dog!
	Woman	I'll take four!
	Leela	Me too!
	Mom	Oh, what the hell.
	Hermes	Here, Dwight. The boots only cost $299.99. You invest this penny like you wanted.
	Dwight	Thanks, Dad. I'm gonna take this and buy five shares of Amazon.com.
	Hermes	A risk-taker? That's my boy!
	Richard Nixon	The entire surplus is gone! Oh, what a McGovern I've been! Why did I have to issue that crooked tax rebate?
	Leela	At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, my, yes.
	Bender	Speaking of which, my story kinda petered out without me learning a lesson.
	Smitty	There he is!
	Bender	Alright! Closure!
	Holo-Roseanne	[over credits] Futurama. Noun. Um, I don't know, you just watched it, dummy. What are you asking me for? Hey, here's a fun definition: Idiot. Noun. You! [She laughs and snorts.] This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts.
