	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?
	Fry	Sure. We talk about it all the time.
	Leela	Really?
	Fry	No. Burn!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela "Orphan of the Year".
	Amy	Yee-ha!
	Bender	Alright!
	Amy	Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry.
	Prof. Farnsworth	And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
	Bender	Neat!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.
	Amy	Whoa, clool!
	Bender	Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
	Bender	[snuffed] Where'd it go?
	Amy	Hey, Professor, what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?
	Prof. Farnsworth	That? It's, uh ... nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything, you're a suspicious moron.
	Hermes	It looks like toxic waste. [He sniffs.] And it smells like toxic waste.
	Fry	What does it taste like?
	Hermes	Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it.
	Hermes	I'm afraid I do. [He takes out his Federal Bureaucracy badge and Farnsworth gasps.] I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.
	Bender	500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?
	Bender	Let's find out.
	Bender	Alright, environment, you've met your match!
	Smitty	Hey, get back in the sewer, weird-y. No mutants on the surface.
	Vyolet	But he ruined my wedding dress.
	Bender	Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
	Warden Vogel	Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan -- not if I have anything to do with it. [He chuckles to himself.] But today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself. [He smiles to Leela. She smiles back.] I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!
	Warden Vogel	What the--? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha-- [Leela kicks him.] Well, come on in.
	Warden Vogel	From those humble beginnings, Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni.
	Leela	Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents...
	Warden Vogel	[hammering] Give me a--
	Leela	I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--
	Warden Vogel	There we are. Picture's up.
	Bender	[shouting] It's crooked!
	Leela	In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today.
	Kids	[chanting] Leela! Leela! Leela!
	Nina	Look at me! I'm Leela!
	Albert	Nuh-uh! 'Cause I'm double Leela!
	Warden Vogel	That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you.
	Photographer	Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?
	Leela	Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
	Fry	If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying.
	Leela	[crying] It's OK, Fry. I'm fine. I won an award today.
	Fry	Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk.
	Leela	I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
	Fry	Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
	Leela	I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me.
	Fry	Then today's your lucky day, because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'.
	Leela	That's not even close to what I had in mind.
	Fry	Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you.
	Leela	I know. [They both look up at the stars.] Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me.
	Fry	Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?
	Bender	My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
	Leela	Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!
	Bender	Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down--
	Bender	[shouting] What did I do to deserve this?
	Dwayne	Behold, our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake.
	Vyolet	The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are.
	Dwayne	Oh, man!
	Raoul	As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!
	Leg Mutant	Tell me about it!
	Raoul	Let the punishment commence!
	Leela	Punishment?
	Fry	No fair!
	Bender	Bender's innocent!
	Raoul	The instant you touch these mutatious waters, your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him! [He points at the leg mutant who sighs.] Allow me to demonstrate!
	Fry	It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
	Raoul	Submerge the prisoners.
	Bender	Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
	Dwayne	We're gonna beat you afterwards.
	Mutants	[chanting] Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ...
	Hooded Figure #1	[shouting] Turanga Leela!
	Leela	Who said that? How do you know my real name?
	Bender	Whee!
	Raoul	What are you doing? Stop it!
	Fry	What happened?
	Leela	I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
	Raoul	[shouting] Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!
	Raoul	They went this way!
	Bender	Quick! In there!
	Dwayne	Kill! Kill! Kill!
	Leela	Great Cheech's ghost!
	Bender	What's this junk?
	Leela	It looks like ... a timeline of my whole life.
	Fry	That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
	Leela	And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
	Bender	And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
	Leela	It's like some kind of weird Leela museum ... and I'm the Leela!
	Fry	[whispering] Dude! Over here!
	Leela	It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
	Fry	And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.
	Leela	[shivering] Oh, I'm scared! [She strokes her ponytail.] My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!
	Vyolet	[from outside] They must be in here.
	Raoul	[from outside] Yeah, after them.
	Bender	And then Bender ran!
	Fry	Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!
	Dwayne	Got you!
	Leg Mutant	Take this!
	Fry	Ow!
	Raoul	This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for re-election as Supreme Mutant.
	Mutants	[chanting] Four more years! Four more years!
	Raoul	Oh, very well. [He turns to the mutants.] Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return.
	Bender	[sarcastic] Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?
	Leela	Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
	Bender	Yeah! What are you chicken?
	Fry	[whispering] Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!
	Raoul	They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
	Bender	Ew!
	Raoul	We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons. Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's left ear and right shin, Garfield's owner Jon's forehead.
	Mutant #1	Fire up the sewer gas!
	Mutant #2	Move it, you ugly normals!
	Bender	Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!
	Fry	[from outside] Come on, Leela. You can do it!
	Bender	[from outside] Hurry! We're missing our bus!
	Fry	[from outside] Whoa! What are you doing?
	Bender	[from outside] I'm gettin' on the bus!
	Leela	[shouting] Don't worry! I'll be fine! [She looks down again.] [talking] They know something about me and I've got to find out what. [She swan dives off the ladder, into the sewage. She appears to emerge as a mutant with an octopus head. She takes the octopus off and looks at her reflection.] The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?
	Octopus	It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
	Leela	Eurgh! [She throws the octopus back into the sewage, turns and sees the hooded figures. She gasps.] Who the hell are you?
	Hooded Figure #1	No one. And watch your language, young lady!
	Mutant #2	Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you. [Leela kicks him over.] I didn't want you to hurt me either!
	Fry	Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
	Warden Vogel	Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
	Fry	That's impossible because my time is worthless!
	Warden Vogel	Huh. Well then there is one thing. [He pulls out a file.] It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla.
	Fry	Hand it over.
	Warden Vogel	Sure. [He hands Fry the paper.] I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans?
	Fry	Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later.
	Fry	Can you translate it?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex there's even less chance of understanding it.
	Fry	I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Very well.
	Fry	Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It can do other things. Why shouldn't it? [He throws the switch.] Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message, there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years.
	Fry	Is it done?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Certainly not. Two dings means it's done. [Two dings.] But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
	Leela	Where did they go?
	Bender	Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy.
	Leela	Ew!
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's it! It's done! [Fry gasps.] I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now.
	Doctor	It's a girl.
	Mother	My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.
	Father	Good people skills!
	Mother	She's completely perfect!
	Doctor	In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the least-mutated mutant ever born.
	Father	And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of us. Especially him!
	Leg Mutant	It's true!
	Mother	Maybe we can do better for her.
	Father	I made this bracelet so that in some small way we'll always be with you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example.
	Mother	You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-linguistics is worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien. [She attaches the note to the baby's blanket.] And that'll be enough to give you a real life.
	Father	She'll never know we're her parents.
	Mother	That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin.
	Father	I'm with you.
	Warden Vogel	What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha-- [The baby kicks him.] Well, come on in.
	Hooded Figure #1	Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us.
	Hooded Figure #2	What's there to talk about?
	Hooded Figure #1	Sh!
	Leela	Hands up! [One hooded figure puts it's hands up.] Tentacles too!
	Hooded Figure #1	Don't say anything stupid, Morris.
	Leela	What is all this? [She points to the wall with all her pictures on it.] Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dalai Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
	Hooded Figure #2	Well, actually, there--
	Hooded Figure #1	Morris! Sh!
	Leela	[angry] And what about this [She pulls a bracelet off one of them. She compares it to her own.] How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!
	Hooded Figure #2	[sombre] Yes. We killed them.
	Hooded Figure #1	You guessed the truth.
	Leela	Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
	Hooded Figure #1	That would be best.
	Fry	Stop! [He falls through the roof along with some noses.] Thanks, Bender! Don't do it, Leela!
	Leela	They killed my parents!
	Fry	Close.
	Leela	They are my parents.
	Turanga Munda	Yes.
	Fry	I had the Professor analyse the Alienese letter that was found with you.
	Leela	What does it say?
	Fry	I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
	Turanga Munda	It says, "Your parents love you very much".
	Turanga Morris	We still do.
	Leela	So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant.
	Turanga Morris	We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life.
	Turanga Munda	You must despise us.
	Leela	[crying] You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you. [They hug.] This is the happiest moment of my life.
	Bender	Aw!
