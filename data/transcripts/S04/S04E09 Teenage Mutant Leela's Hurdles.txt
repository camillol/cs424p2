	Prof. Farnsworth	Pazuzu, you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college, and this is how you repay me?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles, driving thong. There!
	Leela	Uh, maybe I should drive.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster, not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat.
	Fry	My God! He's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[shouting; from ship] Pazuzu? Oh, Pazuzu?
	Randy Munchnik	[from car] Hey, grandpa, move your wrinkly old kiester!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[from ship] Shut up!
	Leela	For Heaven's Gate, Professor. This ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going 35 miles an hour?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Because we're in a hurry, that's why.
	Leela	Plus, you have the high beams on!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[from ship] I can't quite read the sign. [The high beams vaporise the sign and then destroy a space station similar to Deep Space Nine.] Pazuzu? Pazuzu?
	Bender	Yo, Captain Cataract? What are we doing here?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, it's 2.30. We can still catch the early bird dinner special.
	Fry	Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?
	Prof. Farnsworth	My wha?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hello, Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?
	Wanda	Mavis is dead.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I expect you'll want to see my angry, crotchety, grandpa discount card.
	Wanda	Sir, this card has expired.
	Prof. Farnsworth	But it's good for a lifetime.
	Wanda	Well, yours expired.
	Leela	Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants, Professor.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear-powered!
	Fry	Ow! It bit my finger!
	Leela	No! No! It's tasted human blood!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Mmm! Damn good meat!
	Leela	Professor, we've talked it over and everybody thinks you're too old.
	Amy	Right on.
	Fry	Yup.
	Bender	Uh-huh!
	Hermes	We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you euthasised.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Dear God, no!
	Amy	Oh, relax, Professor. "Youthasizing" is a trendy, new spa treatment. It's this season's shark-cartilage enema.
	Prof. Farnsworth	But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's "edgy" TV sitcoms.
	Leela	OK, OK. We're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence. Get him!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[shouting] My thong!
	Heather	Hi! I'm Heather, your personal Youthasizer. Let's get started with a nice botulism treatment, shall we?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Go to hell, Heather!
	Heather	Oh! [She smiles and draws a syringe of warm canned mushrooms.] In small doses, botchelism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Give me back my floppy face!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Careful with the giblets!
	Heather	Hmm. You're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints. [She turns to the masseuse.] More pressure.
	Heather	Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll have to try our strongest treatment: A soothing full-body bath in searing-hot tar. [She indicates the pits.] Sir, it's not necessary or wise to be naked.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You sound just like my tennis instructor.
	Heather	The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists suspect is a miracle.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
	Fry	He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
	Bender	Step aside, lady. [He starts pumping.] Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending. [He pumps harder and the tar starts bobbing around. It throws Farnsworth up and down. The staff watch.] [mean voice] C'mon, Bender, pump harder! Harder! [weak voice] I'm trying as hard as I can. [mean voice] Harder, damn you!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, that was an utter waste of time.
	Amy	Professor, it worked! You look young enough to be my father!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Poodle spit! [Heather scans him and the scanner displays "53". He gasps.] 53 years old? [He sighs.] Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.
	Fry	[voice breaking] This is great, Professor! We should go out and celebrate!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Dear Lord! You've all reverted to your childhood forms.
	Zoidberg	Hooray! I'm a teenage heartthrob again!
	Prof. Farnsworth	While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals.
	Hermes	It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy! [He fires one at Zoidberg.] Stop it, Amy!
	Amy	You stink!
	Hermes	You know you did it!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Quiet! Quiet, I say!
	LaBarbara	We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth.
	Hermes	Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth!
	Leela	Hey! This my chance to spend time with my parents too.
	Fry	But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
	Leela	When I was an orphan, I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards in time--
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
	Leela	It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad.
	Turanga Morris	Can't I just beat up the kid?
	Turanga Munda	Well, OK, Leela. If you think you can put up with your father, then welcome home. We'll try to respect your independence and freedom.
	Leela	No! I want the real teen experience: Chores, curfew, the works!
	Turanga Morris	Fine, Sweetiekins, we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, let's all have some tequila to celebrate!
	Leela	Dad! I'm underage!
	Turanga Morris	Oh, right. Here's a silly straw.
	Mrs. Wong	Oh, my Amy's sweet little girl again! This is like a mother's dream. Bad dream, that is! At this rate, I'm never going to get a grandchild!
	Mr. Wong	Maybe she not grown up but she sure grown out! She fat!
	Amy	Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again, I'm just gonna stay in my room.
	Mr. Wong	Stay in room? You so fat, you gonna stay all around room!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours. And those jerks at social security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!
	Bender	I'm tired of your yapping. [He rides into the room on a motorbike and knocks over a table.] All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Fine! Get going!
	Bender	Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all "Where's Bender? I miss Bender".
	Prof. Farnsworth	We won't know that until you leave.
	Bender	Oh, I'm leaving!
	Prof. Farnsworth	There's the door.
	Bender	I'll be good.
	Turanga Munda	Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?
	Turanga Morris	I'm getting the doorbell. [He gets up and opens the door. Fry stands in the doorway with flowers.] For me?
	Fry	[voice breaking] Oh, uh, hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um, I'm here to pick up your daughter.
	Leela	Hi, Fry! I like your blazer.
	Fry	Thanks. These aren't pockets, they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
	Turanga Munda	So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?
	Fry	[voice breaking] A movie. [deep voice] A movie, ma'am.
	Turanga Morris	Well, whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12.
	Leela	Dad, you're being too lenient again! I have to be back by 11.
	Turanga Munda	OK, OK. You're the boss!
	Leela	No, I'm not!
	Fry	I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat faeces.
	Leela	What are you, on a diet?
	Moose	Uh, Leela, you look hot.
	Mandy	Jeez, Moose! Just dump me right in front of her, why don't you.
	Leela	Moose, Mandy; this is my friend Fry, from the surface.
	Mandy	Oh, so this is the famous Fry. What is he, like, the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?
	Fry	[whispering] They're onto me!
	Leela	Hey, come on! Let's act like grown-ups here. Wanna race?
	Moose	Uh, yeah!
	Sal	Theres. The world's drinkings water is safes for another days. [Moose's car comes flying through.] Whoas! [Followed by Leela's car.] Cripe!
	Leela	A tapeworm!
	Fry	We missed the turn. We'll never catch them.
	Leela	Yes, we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express, and it's 9pm!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[from bathroom] The devil take this predictable colon!
	Fry	Yeah!
	Leela	Alright!
	Fry	Leela, you can stop winning now. We won!
	Leela	I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
	Dwayne	That's detention!
	Fry	And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose. But, in the meantime, I have good news. I may have solved our age problem.
	Fry	Yay!
	Prof. Farnsworth	It seems the Youthasizing tar was saturated with time-altering Chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's robo, or "RNA".
	Bender	Question.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes?
	Bender	You stink!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed an oil-eating bacterium that should take the tar right off.
	Fry	[voice breaking] C'mon! Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
	Leela	Thanks, Professor. But I don't want the treatment.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Don't you understand, you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended.
	Turanga Munda	He has a point, honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life?
	Leela	My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here, with you. Please?
	Turanga Munda	Well if it's what you really want.
	Leela	It is. I know it is.
	Fry	I'll miss you, Leela. I'll come back and visit when I'm all grown up.
	Leela	[whispering] Bring beer.
	Turanga Morris	No beer till you finish your tequila!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[shouting] The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber.
	Amy	Let's go!
	Bender	[sarcastic] Yes, everyone do the same thing!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Initiating controlled infection.
	Zoidberg	I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge.
	Amy	Aw, pooh! We're even younger!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Day-umn! The bacteria pigged-out on the tar and now they're getting freaky-deaky, spreading Chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!
	Amy	Yikes!
	Zoidberg	What? I'm going to revert through all my larval stages?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death: Pre-life ... then death.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I've got to stop this reverse-aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of un-birth. Think, you disco duck, think!
	Amy	What's that squirmal under your shirt?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!
	Zoidberg	Oh, sure, like you need all your blood.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh, I need a babysitter.
	Leela	OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongue and I'll read you a story.
	Zoidberg	I can't see from down here, I can't.
	Leela	There. Today's story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four-legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
	Fry	I wanna hear a space story!
	Leela	It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging.
	Prof. Farnsworth	The Fountain of Aging? Hmm. It is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now he's head of the FBI.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Sup? Kids ready?
	Fry	Professy's back! [He lets go.] Ew! You smell like smoking! [He sniffs.] And drinking.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
	Leela	I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown-ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over.
	Turanga Munda	Who cares, Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please.
	Leela	No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
	Leela	Until she sneaks out!
	Bender	When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!
	Leela	According to this, the Fountain is located in the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past Teddy Bear Junction.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Teddy Bear Junction: The worst scum-hole in the galaxy.
	Prof. Farnsworth	This solar system is, like, way old.
	Leela	Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that ancient, burnt-out sun.
	Leela	Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Shut up! I was gonna say that!
	Leela	We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
	Prof. Farnsworth	We gotta be real, real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again. [Zoidberg falls in and rapidly ages.] [shouting] Zoidberg! Get out of there!
	Zoidberg	[shouting] The current! It's too much, already! Help!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Jeepers!
	Leela	Zoidberg is dead!
	Zoidberg	No! Zoidberg's brother is dead! [Zoidberg has many heads and sits on the steps.] Funny story: I just reverted to the age where my siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
	Sibling #1	He always had to be the centre of attention!
	Sibling #2	Let him go!
	Leela	Oh, no! [The kids revert to foetuses in goo. Bender reverts to a CD of Bending Unit Blueprints.] Quick! Get them into the fountain!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Thanks for the help, Weewa. Once we're gwown up, you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again.
	Leela	Well, you could bother me a little.
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's working! Hooray! [He starts to lose his grip.] I can't hold on!
	Leela	I'm coming in after you!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[shouting] No, Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!
	Fry	We did it! We're the right ages again!
	Leela	I think I might be a couple years younger.
	Amy	Oh, me too!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[shouting] Help! I'm still in mid-peril, you clods!
	Leela	He's too far out! We can't reach him!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[shouting] With my last breath I curse Zoidberg! [He disappears into the vortex. Pazuzu comes out from under the ships wing and flies in and saves him.] Pazuzu! Oh, you came back to me!
	Hermes	Are you back to your original age, Professor?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Even older! Huzzah!
	Fry	I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela.
	Leela	Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am.
	Fry	The fabulous person!
	Leela	With friends like you guys--
	Fry	Fabulous friends!
	Leela	And I'm really happy I have that life back.
	Prof. Farnsworth	And you, my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?
	Pazuzu	["French" accent] And zat, little one, is how Papa gained his freedom. Now, bonne nuit, bonne nuit to you all!
