	Man	$10, please.
	Fry	Aw, man!
	Nannybot 1.0	Sleep, little dumpling. I have replaced your mother.
	Leela	Aw!
	Bender	Oh, my God! Robot beely-boppers!
	Fry	And there's a robot scratching post. [Robots bat around a beer bottle on the scratching post.] You should try it out, Bender.
	Bender	Please, I have some dignity!
	Wernstrom	Ladies and gentlemen, my Killbot features Lotus Notes and a machine gun. It is the finest available.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Like fun it is, you glass-headed wallaby!
	Wernstrom	No one calls me that! I'm having at you!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wernstrom!
	Farnsworth's Killbot	Such senseless aggression.
	Wernstrom's Killbot	Come on. Let's go for a paddle-boat ride.
	Bender	The secret was scratching really, really hard!
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] And now, the woman who Mom-opolises the robot industry--
	Fry	[shouting] I get it!
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] Mom!
	Fry	[shouting] Oh, now I get it!
	Mom	Hello, dearies.
	Bender	Woo! I love that old bat!
	Mom	Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year in a row, the future of robotics has arrived. Boys? [Walt, Larry and Igner come up in the middle of the stage in a puff of smoke.] I give you ... Robot 1-X!
	Larry	Ow!
	Igner	Ow! Oh!
	Bender	Neat!
	Mom	Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?
	Bender	Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!
	Refreshment-bot	Jerk!
	Bender	Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom.
	Mom	Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.
	Bender	Man, that smells great!
	Mom	Now, let's see how both robots do at a typical household task: Sorting a jar of pocket change.
	Robot 1-X	Task completed. Total value, $4.73 and one Albanian lek.
	Mom	Very good, Robot 1-X. And you, bending unit?
	Bender	Uh, I never got the change. [He sniggers.] Suckers.
	Mom	Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots.
	Bender	That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
	Bender	[hoarse] Eep!
	Leela	Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?
	Robot 1-X	I can and will.
	Bender	Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me.
	Leela	I asked you five minutes ago.
	Bender	You call that a kiss? I'll show you! [He stands up and picks up Nibbler.] C'mere, Nibbler!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, look, Bender. If you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.
	Hermes	Here. Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours.
	Bender	Yes, sir. I'm on it!
	Hermes	Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you.
	Bender	Get outta here, freshman! I don't need your help.
	Robot 1-X	Our owners asked me to assist you.
	Bender	Yeah? Well assist this!
	Bender	When I screamed "help" I didn't mean you!
	Robot 1-X	I apologise. However, I was able to do your job before I saved your life.
	Bender	Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
	Amy	Spleesh! Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV.
	Bender	I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
	Leela	Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.
	Bender	Never!
	Leela	Why can't you accept his help?
	Bender	I hate him.
	Leela	But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.
	Bender	I can't ask for his help because--
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes?
	Bender	[whispering] I'm scared of him.
	Leela	Oh, sorry.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well then there's only one solution: You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
	Bender	An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?
	Fry	Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.
	Bender	Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes! For God's sakes, yes!
	Bender	[crying] Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
	Roberto	Man, I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these!
	Bender	Yeah! Right on, nutcake!
	Roberto	Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me. [A piece of machinery grabs him and lifts him off the conveyor belt and puts him on the upgrade machine. His arms are clamped to the machine and something comes down around his face.] Death to the 1-X robots! [The technician throws a switch and the upgrade starts. Electricity zaps around Roberto's head then stops. The machine around his face comes away.] I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.
	Bender	W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
	Roberto	I'm past that. Later, blood!
	Bender	It's like he's not him anymore. [He is placed on the upgrade machine. The technician resets it.] You took away his robo-humanity. [The technician throws the switch and Fatbot trembles as Bender is upgraded.] I changed my mind!
	Bender	I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life? [The seagull squawks.] I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it. [He cries and walks over to a "Boating Prohibited" sign, rips it down and folds it into a boat. He climbs into it and pushes it away from the riverbank.] And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity on this mechanical mariner. [He sails away from the land towards and storm.] Oh, jeez!
	Bender	[shouting] Curse you, merciful Poseidon!
	Bender	Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter. [He walks across the beach, lies down, picks up a rock and dumps it on top of him.] There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.
	Bender	Damn. One rock short of rescue!
	Bender	Oop! Low on power. [He chuckles.] Better fuel up! [The bottle is empty.] Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze.
	Bender	Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.
	Bender	Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
	Bender	Beer! [He throws the rock off him. The beer is a hallucination and is nothing more than six birds trapped in a six pack ring. Bender tries to pull one out and it bites him.] Ow!
	Bender	Who ... is ... it? [A coconut drops on his head.] Ow!
	Bender	Who are you and why should I care?
	Cartridge Unit	[mechanical voice] Side A. [normal voice] We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade and came here-- [He takes the cartridge out, flips it over and puts it back in.] [mechanical voice] Side B. [normal voice] To live a simpler existence, free of technology.
	Bender	A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
	Cartridge Unit	Your mother.
	Lisa	What Cartridge Unit means is the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep refilling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever. [Her wheel runs dry and she panics.] [screaming] Oh, God! I'll never make it this time! This is the end! [She runs down the beach and into the sea. The wheel refills and she walks out.] [talking] Anyway, we like it here.
	Bender	Like you have a choice. [He turns to the other robot, a Sinclair 2K.] So what's your problem?
	Sinclair	Not enough... uh--
	Bender	Memory?
	Sinclair	Oh, great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.
	Lisa	[screaming] Oh, God, no! I want to live! [She leaps into the water again then calmly returns to the group.] [talking] If you'd like, you're welcome to join our society.
	Bender	Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?
	Sinclair	Why would you wanna watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?
	Bender	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
	Bender	Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that next pebble! Wait, wait! Oh, my God! He made it!
	Lisa	Yeah!
	Sinclair	Way to go!
	Bender	That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party! [He takes a CD out of his chest cabinet and puts it in his mouth, which acts as a CD player. He starts dancing to Kenny Loggins' I'm Alright.] Yeah, baby! C'mon!
	Lisa	Where did you get that CD?
	Bender	It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!
	Lisa	CDs are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
	Bender	Which ocean? That ocean? [He turns around and listens.] Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet, salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage. [He empties the other discs out of his chest cabinet and stamps on them, cracking and breaking them.] Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!
	Bender	Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey.
	Lisa	Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore.
	Bender	Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w-- [He turns around and sees the robots staring at him. He stands up and closes the door and looks around at the simple beach huts and the mother boar feeding her children. He picks up the washing machine and throws it into the bay.] You--!
	Lisa	What? I don't understand.
	Sinclair	Is he alright?
	Bender	Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
	Cartridge Unit	But, Bender, you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island.
	Bender	Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function. [He turns around.] But not for long!
	Bender	[from hut] Oh! Ow, that hurt! Oh!
	Lisa	[from hut] The downgrade is complete!
	Bender	Behold, my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!
	Lisa	Welcome to your new life of simple tranquillity.
	Bender	Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
	Cartridge Unit	What?!
	Bender	We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
	Cartridge Unit	What?!
	Bender	[from submarine] Row, comrades! Row!
	Bender	We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
	Lisa	We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope.
	Bender	Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!
	Lisa	Did you see anything?
	Bender	Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!
	Bender	And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!
	Sinclair	Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!
	Cartridge Unit	I'm for that!
	Bender	Whoa, whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult, Sinclair. [Sinclair loads a rock into the catapult. The submarine faces the Planet Express building.] Aim for their power lines. They're the devil's veins and electricity is his blood.
	Lisa	Bender, If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know ... I love you.
	Bender	OK, fine. Fire!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[shouting] Oh! I'm blind!
	Leela	Professor, we have no power.
	Prof. Farnsworth	What do you mean "no power"? We're living in the future.
	Leela	I'd better light some candles.
	Bender	Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the "complicated" part I mean not the "lives" part.
	Leela	Oh, Lord, he's made of wood! What now, Bender?
	Bender	I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X.
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's just stupid.
	Robot 1-X	Does Mr. Bender wish me to destroy myself?
	Bender	I don't need your charity. [He turns to the hole.] [shouting] Target Robot 1-X and fire!
	Prof. Farnsworth	You wanged my ship, you walnut-panelled idiot!
	Bender	[shouting] Try again, Sinclair. I said "target Robot 1-X"!
	Sinclair	[shouting; from submarine] Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.
	Zoidberg	So, I guess everything worked out fine.
	Leela	Great! Now we're being crushed.
	Amy	Help us, wooden Bender!
	Bender	Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something. [He climbs down a ladder and walks towards a fire extinguisher on the wall. His left leg snaps and termites pour out from inside it.] What the--? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!
	Hermes	Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also [shouting] we're dying!
	Bender	I'm a-comin' [He turns over, extends his eyes and starts walking towards the flames with them. He catches fire.] Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!
	Robot 1-X	Sir, might I recommend--
	Bender	You shut up. No, wait! I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!
	Robot 1-X	How may I help you?
	Bender	Save my friends! [He screams.] And Zoidberg!
	Amy	Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!
	Fry	Hey, where's Bender?
	Bender	Down here. [The crew look down and wince. Bender is nothing more than a pair of eyes, a face and a pile of ash. Hermes gasps.] I'm so sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
	Leela	Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.
	Bender	Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like "Save them!" and he was all "No problem!" and then he did it--
	Bender	This new technology is great! [The machine stops.] I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
	Fatbot	It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea.
	Bender	I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the-- [He looks around.] Hey! What's the dealy-o?
	Technician	Your upgrade is complete.
	Bender	But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
	Technician	[shrugging] Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.
	Bender	Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?
	Technician	No, get out. [He presses a button and the conveyor belt starts up.] Next.
	Bender	Well, I guess reality is what you make of it. [He crosses the road and walks down a flower-lined path with a white horse and lush trees nearby. He takes out a cigar and a fairy lights it for him.] Oh, thanks, baby!
