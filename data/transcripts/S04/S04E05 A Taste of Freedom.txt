	Zoidberg	[singing] Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
	Fry	There's no denying it, the future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out.
	Zoidberg	and Zoidberg: [singing] Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
	Zoidberg	There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!
	Prof. Farnsworth	...an extremely dangerous mission...
	Fry	So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product.
	Zoidberg	No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!
	Amy	If you wanna do something, you do it, and to splick with the consequences!
	Bender	You know, like how I live every day.
	Hermes	Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!
	Hermes	Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!
	Fry	Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
	Zoidberg	Then consider the following lecture a bonus: On Earth, freedom is a given. But on my planet, we have to suffer for it.
	Decapodian Woman	Sure, you can be a comedian instead of a doctor -- if you want your parents to roll over in their graves!
	Decapodian Man	Sure, you can vote for Shkinadel -- if you want there should be a recession!
	Decapodian Woman	Sure, you can go to medical school -- if you've given up on your dream of being a comedian!
	Zoidberg	That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no one makes you feel guilty because no one cares.
	Fry	[shouting] We're not listening!
	Zoidberg	That's what I'm talking about!
	Stilt People	[chanting] Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!
	Bender	Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one.
	Woman	Ow! You broke my foot!
	Bender	Freedom!
	Morbo	What's this next float, Linda?
	Linda	Representing our men, women and children in uniform, it's Earth's greatest space hero, Zapp Brannigan!
	Zapp	Happy Freedom Day, ladies! [He throws some beads.] Come on, let loose and show me something! [He throws more beads.] Anything. Seriously, I'd take an armpit. [Kif sighs.] Oh, yeah! Thank you, Linda!
	Linda	You're welcome! OK, Morbo, now it's your turn.
	Morbo	If that is your Freedom Day wish.
	Richard Nixon	Thank you, Secretary of Transportation. My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a weekend with the Pain Monster.
	Pain Monster	See you April 15th, folks!
	Richard Nixon	Cue the fireworks guy! [A man jets up to the sky and blows up a firework.] Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration is brought to you by ... [A firework explodes and "Shankman" lights up the sky.] ... "Shankman's Rubbing Compound". When something needs rubbing, think "Shankman".
	Bender	Yay! Shankman!
	Hermes	It costs a little more but it's worth it!
	Richard Nixon	Our planet has been through so much this past year: Wars, droughts, impeachments! But we've never lost our sense of what's truly important: The great taste of "Charleston Chew"! [A "Charleston Chew" firework explodes.] And now, let us salute that beloved symbol of freedom, our flag, Ol' Freebie!
	Zoidberg	I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
	Richard Nixon	In our darkest hour we can stand erect, with proud, upthrust bosoms!
	Fry	Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
	Richard Nixon	Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward, we will see by the rocket's red glare that our flag is still there. [He turns around.] It's gone!
	Zoidberg	Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people!
	Richard Nixon	[shouting] Kill him! Kill the traitor!
	Man #1	Hey, it's the guy who desecrated our flag!
	Richard Nixon	Stop that red menace!
	Zoidberg	I'm all scuttled out! [He looks up and sees something.] Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!
	Zoidberg	I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry.
	Decapodian Man	What sorry? Our planet stinks, we all know it.
	Ambassador Mervin	Enough with the persecution, I'm saying. Zoidberg, as Ambassador, I promise you the full support of our government, already.
	Decapodian Woman	Poor boy. You want maybe a nice mug cocoa?
	Zoidberg	Ambassador Mervin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled. [The woman comes back in with the cocoa and hands it to Zoidberg.] What, no marshmallows?
	Richard Nixon	Let's storm the place ... without my prior knowledge.
	Bender	Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!
	Leela	Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution.
	Richard Nixon	Aroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat.
	Myrtle Fu	The Supreme Court hereby accepts the case of Earth vs. Zoidberg.
	Richard Nixon	Sock it to 'em!
	Crowd	[chanting] Two, four, six, eight,Eating the flag is bad.
	Scout Leader	Now your noose knot has exactly seven twists.
	Man #2	[singing] You can eat my dog,You can eat my truck,But you eat my flag,And you're outta luck!She's a-wavin' proud around the world,From Dallas to Fort Worth,Let me say it again...
	Crowd	[chanting] Don't mess with Earth!
	Fry	They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
	Bender	Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
	Fry	Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
	Leela	I'll ask the head of the ACLU -- once he's done singing.
	Man #2	[singing] Don't mess with Earth. [talking] Kill Zoidberg! Goodnight!
	Old Man Waterfall	Howdy there! I'm a lawyer and I'd like to help your friend out of his pickle.
	Fry	Who are you, old man?
	Old Man Waterfall	Name's Old Man Waterfall but most folks just call me "Old Man".
	Fry	I'll never remember that.
	Old Man Waterfall	I'm a veteran of three dozen wars. Name a body part and a planet and I've taken a bullet in it, on it. All to keep our flag flying free.
	Bender	And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying "does not compute"?
	Old Man Waterfall	Son, to me a robot's just a garbage can with sparks comin' out it.
	Bender	[sad] The sparks keep me warm.
	Old Man Waterfall	I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively.
	Fry	Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!
	Fry	You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?
	Holo-Zoidberg	No. There's no cocoa marshmallows, and every night the rats eat a little more of my foot!
	Bailiff	Oyez, oyez, oyez. All rise for the Honourable Chief Justice, Myrtle Fu, and the Associate Justices.
	Myrtle Fu	Counsel, you may address the court on behalf of Earth, if you're ready.
	Hyper-Chicken	I was hatched ready! Honourable judge heads, yonder crawdad done ate up our flag.
	Holo-Zoidberg	I was doing freedom of speech, Earth's most sacred right.
	Hyper-Chicken	Your Honour, freedom of speech applies to what comes out of a mouth, not what goes in.
	O'Connor	Can counsel cite precedent?
	Hyper-Chicken	Uh, yes, darlin', I can. In State Of Alabama vs. Giant Space Iguana, chewin' the corners off the Constitution was deemed non-protected speech.
	Souter	He shut you up, O'Connor.
	Myrtle Fu	Mr. Waterfall, you may now present arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg.
	Holo-Zoidberg	Oh, God, I'm nervous. Two of my three hearts are having attacks.
	Bender	Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
	Old Man Waterfall	Oh, land-o-Goshen! Your Honours, I'm not some slick, big-city lawyer like my opponent here. [The Hyper-Chicken caws.] But I am a veteran who has fought for his planet. You see this hand of mine?
	Scalia	Yes, I do.
	Old Man Waterfall	No, you don't [He takes it off.] 'Cause I lost my real hand plantin' the flag when we took back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth it, so much do I love that flag. [The bench sobs.] I love it even more than I love my seven wives -- that's right, I'm a polygamist. [The court "boos".] Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, had I not used my intestine as a rope to hoist a flag made of my own skin, if it would protect the freedoms of the proud people who salute that flag. [The court cheers.] Freedom such as polygamy. [The court "boos".] I rest my case. [He puts his hand back on and his leg falls off.] Whoa, jeez!
	Myrtle Fu	The Justices and I will now confer using high-speed telepathy. [The bailiff hooks them up and the Justices' heads rotate in the jars. Myrtle Fu takes off her helmet.] By a vote of six-to-three, we find that flag eating is not protected by the Constitution.
	Bender	Six-to-three? I beat the spread!
	Myrtle Fu	The court orders an immediate public apology.
	Holo-Zoidberg	Apology accepted. Just don't let it happen again.
	Hermes	She means you, you turkey of the sea!
	Holo-Zoidberg	Me? Apologise? Never! I came to this planet to learn the meaning of freedom, but I say it's you who should get a nice lesson! So do your worst because no punishment could be worse than denying my freedom.
	Myrtle Fu	You are hereby sentenced to death.
	Holo-Zoidberg	Wait, let me finish!
	Myrtle Fu	Also, in a rare double-whammy decision, the court finds polygamy constitutional.
	Old Man Waterfall	I can't wait to tell my husband!
	Zapp	Remember, men, take him alive so there's something left to kill.
	Ambassador Mervin	Stay back! This embassy is sovereign mud of the mud planet Decapod 10. Invading these mud premises is an act of war.
	Zapp	Yeah? Well what are you going to do about it, Shrimp-y?
	Ambassador Mervin	You wanna see, Mr. Big-Shot? [He speaks into a radio.] Attack Earth. [There is a pause.] Yes I know it's a schlep. Just do it!
	Zoidberg	Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!
	Zapp	Ready ... retreat!
	Patron	[from library] Shh!
	Zoidberg	Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!
	Ambassador Mervin	Charleston Chew?
	Zoidberg	You bet!
	Zapp	Alright, Kif, let's show these freaks what a bloated, runaway military budget can do. Bring me the activation codes for our global defence network.
	Kif	[unenthusiastic] Aye, aye, sir.
	Computer Voice	Commence lip identification scan. [Zapp kisses the computer.] No tongue.
	Zapp	We can't be too careful with these codes. Rumour has it a double agent may be aboard this very ship. [He looks Kif square in the eyes.] I'm watching you! You, ensign, what's your name?
	"Ensign"	Hugh Man, sir.
	Zapp	Hugh Man? Now that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle computer and enter these codes. Chop, chop!
	Kif	Um, sir? There's something about that ensign that's--
	Zapp	You're damn right there is! That strapping young lad's gunning for your job. And he just might get it.
	Zapp	The enemy approacheth! Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me for another medal. Make it gaudy, I'm going clubbing later. [Kif presses a button but nothing happens. He presses it again three times.] Tick, tock!
	Kif	Sir, all planetary defences have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians acquired our secret codes, somehow.
	Zapp	Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!
	Leela	Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?
	Zoidberg	Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say.
	Fry	Ow!
	Bender	What the hell is this dirt pile we're building, anyhow?
	Zoidberg	None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud. [shouting] Glob!
	Fry	I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know, to become a barber?
	Leela	This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
	Bender	It's already 10 o'clock!
	Leela	Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back.
	Zapp	Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless.
	Bender	I know I am.
	Fry	Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know, a headache with pictures?
	Leela	An idea?
	Fry	Back in my day we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons, but we still managed to kill each other just fine.
	Bender	Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century.
	Fry	Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
	Bender	Wow! [He shoots the crossbow through his nose hole.] Ow!
	Ambassador Mervin	Earth slaves, behold the fruit of your labours: The Mobile Oppression Palace.
	Bender	Neat!
	Ambassador Mervin	I don't need to tell you that occupation forces are expensive. But with the Mobile Oppression Palace, a few dignitaries can oppress your entire planet for pennies a day. [On a balcony the dignitaries laugh and sneer.] Warships, dismissed!
	Old Man Waterfall	Do your worst, you sea devils! I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! [The Palace crushes him with a giant claw. Old Man Waterfall screams from under the claw.] My spirit!
	Frieda Waterfall	Great Grandpa, no! [She shakes her fist at the Decapodians.] Another victim of the mano-centric male-ocracy.
	Zoidberg	Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer.
	Ambassador Mervin	You're welcome.
	Zoidberg	He defended my freedom when no one else would. He was a good and honourable man.
	Old Man Waterfall	I request a Satanic funeral.
	Zoidberg	Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?
	Ambassador Mervin	Ah, take a pill, Zoidberg. [shouting] Begin again with the crushing!
	Fry	You haven't won yet, Mervin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile.
	Ambassador Mervin	I don't even know you.
	Decapodian Woman	Oh, it's gonna make such a mess!
	Ambassador Mervin	This is your secret plan? Meh! Heat-seeking missiles are useless against the Mobile Oppression Palace. All Decapodian technology is cold-blooded, like us!
	Zoidberg	All eyes on Zoidberg! [Old Man Waterfall's hand pops off his arm but still clutches the flagpole.] Ew!
	Bender	Hey, I need that to smoke!
	Fry	Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool.
	Zoidberg	Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the freedom it represents!
	Leela	Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say.
	Crowd	[chanting] Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!
	Zoidberg	Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second! They do! Because this is my home planet.
	Richard Nixon	And now, to raise this beautiful new flag, a red lobster that won't ruin your dinner, Dr. John Zoidberg!
	Zoidberg	You're a nice man, Nixon.
	Scoop Chang	Dr. Zoidberg, how's about you take a bite of the flag for tomorrow's papers?
	Zoidberg	Oh, I couldn't.
	Richard Nixon	No, no, no, go ahead. You've earned it!
	Zoidberg	Well, maybe just a taste. [He takes a bite and cameras flash.] Mmm! Now that's a grand, old flag! [The crowd cheers and Zoidberg raises the flag.] I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like.
