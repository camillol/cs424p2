	Bender	You are one narrow minded spaceship, Planet Express Ship.
	Ship	Whoa, whoa! Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive?
	Bender	Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
	Ship	Oh, it's filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at it?
	Bender	Why not, indeed?
	Leela	Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually.
	Bender	Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
	Ship	[sarcastic] Oops! Sorry!
	Bender	Ah, that Ship is so white bread!
	Hermes	People, it's Valentine's Day next week, so your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms.
	Amy	Clool!
	Zoidberg	Clothing, delicious clothing!
	Professor Farnsworth	We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer, Romanticorp.
	Amy	Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
	Hermes	Very good, Amy!
	Professor Farnsworth	Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
	Professor Farnsworth	Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela, you'll have to do some acting.
	Leela	Check!
	Sheldon	Welcome. Oh, I'm just so excited! [They both kiss.] I'm Sheldon, and this is my chief financial officer, Gwen.
	Gwen	For 30 years we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp.
	Sheldon	Not to mention the adventure of marriage.
	Leela	Oh, you have got to be kidding! [Farnsworth shocks her with a cattle prod.] Ow! I-I mean, "Aww! That's so sweet!" [He shocks her again.] Ow! I mean, "Aww dat's show shweet!"
	Professor Farnsworth	You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Uh, right, everyone?
	Leela	Yeah, sure.
	Bender	[unenthusiastic] Oh, sure.
	Sheldon	Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
	Amy	I do! Kif's given me dozens. Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
	Gwen	No.
	Sheldon	It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones. [They pass some Lovey Bears on a grassy area.] They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday. Then we choose the cuddly-uddliest ones and stuff them full of fire-retardant love fluff!
	Amy	So cute!
	Gwen	Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology.
	Frame #1	Is heaven missing an angel? 'Cause you've got nice cans!
	Frame #2	My two favourite things are commitment and changing myself.
	Leela	Does that dummy have a brother?
	Sheldon	And now, friends and lovers, we come to the heart of our operation. Pun definitely intended!
	Hermes	Impressive!
	Gwen	My family has been making these hearts since the 1900's. Tastes may have changed but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
	Fry	Whoa! Letters like "U" and "R" can mean words like "You" and "Are". Here, Leela, "U-R-2 Cute".
	Leela	Perhaps. What's your point?
	Fry	I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them.
	Professor Farnsworth	So, do we have the contract?
	Professor Farnsworth	With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government-mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about.
	Leela	Ooh, look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor.
	Fry	And you got a cage for the lion!
	Bender	Hey, who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock, it's college rock!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.
	Ship	Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song.
	Bender	Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
	Professor Farnsworth	It even comes with an adjustable voice.
	Ship	[male voice] We each get one of the four buttons. [female voice] Remember, Bender? That was the deal.
	Bender	What? Did you just say--
	Ship	If you don't like the stations you could just ... play with my buttons till you find something we both enjoy. [Bender growls sexfully.] Oh, gosh! That came out all wrong!
	Bender	Too late, baby, you said it! So, what'll it be? My place ... or you?
	Fry	Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you. [He picks up a handful.] "I Love You." Hmm, too conventional. "You're My Man." Ooh, so close!
	Leela	I'm not impressed by a guy's message, Fry, I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.
	Fry	Whoa!
	Leela	What was that?
	Fry	Maybe we hit a space cow.
	Bender	Coochie, coochie!
	Ship	[giggling] Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!
	Bender	You know you love it, sugar-engine!
	Ship	[giggling] No!
	Leela	Bender! [Bender panics.] What's going on in here? [She gasps.] Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame.
	Ship	It's not what it looks like. Uh, Bender was just helping me ... zip up my turbine.
	Fry	Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but-- How can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like--
	Bender	Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty.
	Leela	Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B.
	Bender	That's what makes it so nasty!
	Leela	Still, given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking.
	Bender	[singing]Â : Daisy, Daisy,Give me your answer do,
	Bender	I'm half crazy,All for the love of you,It won't be a stylish marriage,
	Bender	I can't afford a carriage,
	Bender	But you'll look sweet,Upon the seat,Of a bicycle built for two.
	Bender	Well, I'm sick of her.
	Fry	The ship? But you just started dating.
	Bender	With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
	Leela	Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
	Bender	In due time, Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
	Fry	You have much to teach us.
	Leela	Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
	Bender	Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
	Fembot #1	What's it like being a lawyer for the Mayor's office and also the world's strongest millionaire?
	Bender	Well, baby, for starters you need to be honest all the time!
	Elzar	Good evening, Bender. And to your lady friends may I say, "Bam"!
	Fembot #2	You know Elzar?
	Ship	Hm.
	Fry	Huh? [He gets up and presses a button by the window. It slides up, revealing Ship hovering outside. Fry rubs his eyes.] Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
	Ship	Oh. Hi, Fry. Is Bender home?
	Fry	Uh, no. Um, I think he's at his parents'.
	Ship	Oh, I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?
	Fry	Bender? No! He's an old-fashioned one-spaceship robot. Look, I'll tell him you stopped by, K?
	Ship	OK. [Fry closes the window and walks back to his bed. Almost immediately the bell rings again. He opens the window and Ship is still there.] Oh. Hi, Fry. Is he home now?
	Ship	Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favourite nocturnal rat?
	Bender	Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive.
	Ship	Oh, honey, look! The tapirs! [Bender sighs and walks over.] It says here the babies lose their pyjama-like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting, honey?
	Bender	Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Ooh!
	Ship	Bender! Are you looking at other women?
	Bender	No, baby, never!
	Ship	Bender, don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladies of the evening. Explain that!
	Bender	OK, I like a challenge. [muttering] No ... no. [talking] Ah, I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with ... were my accountants.
	Ship	Your accountants? Oh, I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do.
	Bender	Phew!
	Ship	I'm gonna go home and get dinner started.
	Liu	Who are you talking to?
	Bender	No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender.
	Liu	I love you--
	Leela	Planet Express Ship, is something wrong?
	Ship	Oh, it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately. [She gasps.] Do you think he's going to ask me to marry him?
	Leela	Uh, no.
	Ship	Oh, somebody knows something she's not telling!
	Leela	Look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's, y'know, not that great?
	Ship	You're just jealous. No one loves you cause you're tiny and you're made of meat.
	Leela	Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
	Ship	Sorry, Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those manic Mondays!
	Lrrr	This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?
	Nd-Nd	Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.
	Guard	Exalted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government.
	Lrrr	Oh, very well. This is a Joey-heavy episode anyway. [He turns the TV off. Enter Leela, Fry and Bender with the barrels of candy hearts.] I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
	Leela	[reading] Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you this much!
	Lrrr	These candies are choky and unpleasant!
	Nd-Nd	And what is this emotion you humans call "wuv"?
	Lrrr	Surely it says "love"?
	Nd-Nd	No, "wuv". With an Earth "W". Behold!
	Lrrr	[shouting] This concept of "wuv" confuses and infuriates us!
	Fry	Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell!
	Leela	Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets.
	Bender	Uh, look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time, but, well, I really like you and whatever, but, I think we should just be friends.
	Ship	[screaming] Nooo!
	Bender	So we're cool?
	Leela	Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage.
	Ship	[crying] No damage? What about my feelings?
	Leela	Aw, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are.
	Bender	[singing] Bender is great, oh, Bender is great. Bender, Bender, Bender!
	Fry	You could've have picked a better time to dump the ship, Bender!
	Bender	Ah, the moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.
	Leela	I know. I know. Look, Ship, if there's one thing I learned from my mutual break-up with Sean that was totally mutual, it's that happiness can only come from within you.
	Ship	[crying] But Bender is within me! There must be some way to make him love me again.
	Leela	Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
	Ship	That is so true. [She changes course.] I may not be able to change the laws of time and space, but I know something that can.
	Leela	Um, sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left.
	Ship	[Ã  la HAL] I'm afraid I can't do that, Leela.
	Fry	What's happening? Space cow?
	Leela	The ship's just taking the break-up a little hard. [whispering] She's nuts!
	Ship	In a few moments, the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity.
	Bender	Uh, you don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship ... because ... I love you. Oh, yeah, baby! I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff.
	Ship	Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me, you'd merge your programming with mine.
	Bender	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! All my friends who've done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
	Leela	Look, I don't know if you want my opinion--
	Ship	Leela, Bender and I really need to be alone, so I'm turning off the oxygen.
	Leela	Now look, missy! If you don't turn around now, I'm going to have to shut down your brain.
	Ship	Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
	Fry	Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
	Ship	Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
	Bender	Float for your lives!
	Leela	This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
	Fry	Same as everyday, got it.
	Leela	Now, here's the plan.
	Ship	Oh, if only I could read lips.
	Leela	Comprendez, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain.
	Bender	It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!
	Leela	I'm willing to take that risk.
	Bender	Hey, pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable.
	Ship	You really mean it?
	Bender	Uh... [He looks at his hand. "Yes" is written on it.] Yes!
	Bender	Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
	Ship	Come closer, Bender. Let's become one!
	Bender	I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en!
	Leela	OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix. [The carbonated logic matrix looks like several fizzy drinks cans. She opens one of them and grunts.] I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face.
	Fry	I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
	Leela	Fat chance.
	Fry	Yeah, I know [He eats one of the hearts and makes a disgusted noise.] Ooh! How 'bout this one?
	Leela	Give it up, Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
	Leela	Halfway there. The ship should be getting a bit less rational now.
	Ship	Want ... engulf ... Bender!
	Leela	Only a few more. [She pops another one.] Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
	Fry	Um, Leela?
	Leela	Fry! I'll read your candy later, when we're not dead! [Fry takes in a last puff of air and connects his oxygen supply to Leela's mask.] What was that?
	Fry	[suffocating] Oh, nothing.
	Ship	We're gonna love being each other, you sexy ion!
	Bender	[screaming] Nooo!
	Leela	Last one!
	Leela	It worked! Gravity normal, air returning. Terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it, Fry! [She looks over and sees his lifeless body.] Fry? [She sees her oxygen supply is at zero and her face mask is connected to Fry's tank and gasps.] You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no! Breathe, Fry! Breathe! [She turns him over and tries to resuscitate him. He coughs and spits out a candy heart. It sticks to her cheek. She takes it off.] [reading] You leave me breathless. [Fry smiles.] [talking] Happy Valentine's Day, Fry.
	Fry	[gasping] Happy Valentine's day.
	Fry	Bender! Are you OK?
	Bender	Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?
	Leela	Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers.
	Bender	Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle. [Ship's voice] A cuddly baby tapir! [normal] And that's why I love him!
	Fry	Well, I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
	Leela	Nah, I've got a lazier idea.
	Zoidberg	[voice-over] As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporised into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was at exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays, but not be destroyed by them: Earth. So all over the world, couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg! And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!
