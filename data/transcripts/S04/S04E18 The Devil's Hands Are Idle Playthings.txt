	Bender	Huh? [He scratches his ass and looks at some signs on Fry's bedroom door. "No Trespassing", "Keep Out", "Private", "Keep Out Bender" and a picture of Bender with a cross through it.] I choose to not understand these signs.
	Bender	Aha!
	Fry	Bender? I was just not playing the holophonor.
	Bender	Yeah, well you should try not stinking at it.
	Fry	I am trying. I've been taking lessons.
	Bender	Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?
	Fry	I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me. [He picks up a photo of Leela and him riding on the back of an angry looking Zoidberg.] Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?
	Bender	Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though.
	Bender	Whoa! Hey!
	Fry	Uh, hello, Mrs. Mellonger.
	Mrs. Mellonger	Hello, Philip. [She looks at Bender.] And you must be Mr. Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?
	Bender	I prefer the term "love machine".
	Bender	Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
	Mother	Fairly hard.
	Fry	The Grumpy Snail. [He plays the holophonor. An image of a grumpy snail slowly crawling along a branch forms. He plays a bad note and the snail turns around and glares at him angrily.] Sorry!
	Boy	[crying] It's too grumpy!
	Fry	Ow! No! Quit it! Stop!
	Mrs. Mellonger	Mr. Bender, I simply cannot teach your child.
	Bender	Then good day, madam! [He pushes Fry through the door and closes it behind him. He opens it again and pokes his head back into the room.] We hope to see you soon for tea.
	Fry	It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
	Bender	Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.
	Leela	Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?
	Fry	At, uh, uh, a concert.
	Leela	Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
	Bender	So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?
	Leela	Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched--
	Fry	[quietly] Pretty boy.
	Leela	But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt. [muttering] I couldn't believe it. I was really...
	Fry	That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
	Bender	Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a "deal with the devil". And by "devil" I mean "Robot Devil". And by "metaphorically" I mean "get your coat".
	Robot Devil	You hit a sour note about 200 years back, Doug! [Doug, the Hellbot with the saxophone, hangs his head in shame.] Let's take it from the top. [Enter Bender and Fry on the slide. They land at the Robot Devil's feet.] Ah, Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation.
	Bender	No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.
	Fry	Yep. I need to get really good without practising.
	Robot Devil	Hell is full of ten-year-olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher, Mrs. Mellonger, calls "stupid fingers". [He twiddles his own fingers then slaps them.] With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle. [Fry looks down and sees his trousers have fallen around his ankles. He quickly pulls them up.] Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?
	Fry	Sure would. [He shrugs.] Oh, well. Goodbye.
	Bender	Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.
	Fry	He-He-He is? [He turns around.] Great! Wait, what's the catch?
	Robot Devil	No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe, probably one you've never even met, and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours. [Bender rubs his hands with glee.] It's just the sort of guy I am. What do you say?
	Fry	I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
	Bender	Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
	Fry	Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
	Robot Devil	Definitely probably not. [A column of rock rises up out of the ground with a piece of paper on top.] Just sign this contract.
	Bender	Wow!
	Robot Devil	And here we go!
	Bender	I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
	Fry	Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
	Robot Devil	Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome.
	Bender	It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!
	Robot Devil	Y'know, I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots.
	Fry	Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
	Robot Devil	Oh, very well.
	Fry	[impressed] How'd you do that?
	Robot Devil	They're very good hands.
	Fry	At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
	Robot Devil	Oh, sorry. That'll wear off in a couple of days.
	Fry	Check it out, everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands.
	Amy	Neat! Let's see a trick.
	Fry	Alrighty!
	Scruffy	Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
	Fry	Uh-oh.
	Bender	Where'd I go just now?
	Robot Devil	Hello, Fry. [He cackles.] Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am. [He cracks and grabs Fry by his jacket.] Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places.
	Fry	Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.
	Robot Devil	Looks like I wasted a bus trip.
	Fry	Yes, you did.
	Grumpy Snail	[on TV] Yes. Now you can hear holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry play 900 of these classic themes in your own home on this two-record set. [Behind him Fry walks along a sunset-lit beach playing his holophonor. The hologram flies to the front of the screen revealing it to be his album. The cover features him lying naked on a bed holding the holophonor.] That's over 30 minutes of music for only $14.99.
	Zoidberg	Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer!
	Man	[on phone] Hello?
	Zoidberg	Hello? I'll take eight!
	Scruffy	Mr. Hedonismbot to see you.
	Fry	Uh, show him in.
	Scruffy	[bowing] Very good, sir.
	Hedonismbot	Ah, Fry. Congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams.
	Fry	Thank you, sir. That's exactly what I was going for.
	Hedonismbot	You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would fain commission you write an opera.
	Fry	But I've never written an opera.
	Hedonismbot	And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success.
	Fry	But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless... [He turns and looks at Leela, who sits at the table gorging on a buggalo leg dripping with barbecue sauce. He smiles and turns to Hedonismbot.] OK, I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.
	Leela	Me? Really?
	Hedonismbot	A man writing an opera about a woman? [He laughs.] Oh, sirrah, how deliciously absurd! [He turns around to the door.] I shall see you at the premiere.
	Leela	Is it part of the opera?
	Fry	Leela! [He stands up.] You shouldn't be listening. I don't want you to hear it till it's done.
	Leela	But it's so beautiful.
	Fry	So's a peacock but you don't eat it until it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
	Leela	Oh, Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully-justified, prudent fool. [She looks into his eyes and holds his hands then quickly takes hers away.] They're so cold.
	Robot Devil	[shouting; from street] And yet hell is so hot! [He laughs briefly.] Can I have my hands back now?
	Fry	[shouting] No!
	Robot Devil	[shouting; from street] You're not nice!
	Robot Devil	Ah, Bender, this is a surprise! For you! Finding me in the refrigerator.
	Bender	True, but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
	Robot Devil	Oh, well it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you.
	Bender	Forget it! You can't tempt me.
	Robot Devil	[tempting] Really? There's nothing you want?
	Bender	Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want. [He scratches his chin and leans against the worktop.] Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying.
	Robot Devil	Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return is your hands. [He looks at Fry's hands.] To replace these bony hotdogs!
	Bender	Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
	Robot Devil	Well is there anything else you would part with?
	Bender	No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen.
	Bender	Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate.
	Robot Devil	You certainly are a shrewd businessman, Bender. [While Bender isn't looking he tosses the crotch-plate into the bin.] Now find someone and give 'em a good blast!
	Bender	Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson.
	Robot Devil	Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is one-quarter complete!
	Leela	Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms.
	Bender	Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?
	Leela	[shouting] What? Are you talking? Oh, God! I'm deaf!
	Bender	Oops. I'm so, so sorry, Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
	Leela	[shouting] What? Oh, this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
	Robot Devil	Ah, how delightfully ironic.
	Bender	It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!
	Robot Devil	Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!
	Bender	Oh, yeah? Well bite my shiny metal-- [He points at where his crotch-plate used to be. No ass left to bite.] [shouting] Oh, nooo!
	Leela	Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart.
	Bender	OK, deaf-o!
	Hedonismbot	Courtesans and gentle fops, I bid you welcome to my opera. Let us cavort like the Greeks of old. [sexfully] You know the ones I mean.
	Leela	Yay, Fry!
	Zoidberg	I watch TV with that guy!
	Warden Vogel	[singing] Who is this one-eyed female baby Moses,With courage in her female baby smile?
	Holo-Orphans	[singing] A saviour from the stars,Or something stranger still.
	Holo-Leela	[singing] Or just a lonely, filthy, starving child.
	Leela	Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am I s'posed to be feeling? [Amy opens a box of "Emotion Flashcards" and takes out one of the hardhat guy crying.] Ah!
	Holo-Bender	[singing] Leela! Leela, Leela save him!Save Fry, save Fry,Godzilla will devour him,As for me,I must be off,To have my doctor check this cough,[He coughs.]Goodbye!
	Bender	I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla, but that is so what I would have done.
	Amy	One diet double Martini, please.
	Bartender	And for you, sir?
	Hermes	I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
	Tinny Tim	Extra! Extra! World's greatest opera only half over.
	Leela	Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest.
	Robot Devil	Anything? [Leela gasps and drops her glass. A man hands the Robot Devil his coat and he hands him a ticket.] Thank you, sir. [The man leaves and the Robot Devil turns to Leela.] Now, as I was saying, anything? Because I can give you new robotic ears!
	Leela	What? You can give me new ears? Wait. What seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?
	Robot Devil	Just your hands, my dear.
	Leela	Whatever you said, forget it!
	Robot Devil	Alright then, just one hand.
	Leela	Just ... my left hand? Um, uh--
	Announcer	Please take your seats for act two.
	Hedonismbot	But I'm not done vomiting.
	Leela	I can't stand it! [She takes a deep breath.] OK. You can have my hand.
	Robot Devil	Wonderful! [He produces another contract.] Just sign here. [Leela signs. Calculon walks by and the Robot Devil stops him.] Calculon, old friend, I'm afraid I need your ears.
	Calculon	Well I do owe you for giving me this unholy [melodramatically] acting talent.
	Leela	I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?
	Robot Devil	In good time. You go enjoy the opera.
	Holo-Fry	[singing] To win Leela's heart with the holophonors art,I need hands of transcendental quickness.
	Holo-Robot Devil	[singing] Well I don't see any danger,In gambling with a stranger,For my head is of a most amazing thickness.
	Holo-Robot Devil	[singing] I'm stupid, I'm stupid,I'm stupider than you,I'm stupider than you in every way.
	Robot Devil	Stupider? Pah! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! [He kicks the Holo-Robot Devil actor off the stage. The audience gasps. Fry stops playing and the holo-scene fades, leaving the Holo-Fry actor standing on the stage in his underpants.] Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry.
	Fry	Look, what do you want?
	Robot Devil	[singing] I want my hands back.
	Fry	Never!(singing) A deal's a deal,Even with a dirty dealer.
	Robot Devil	[singing] Very well,Then I'll take what I want from Leela.
	Leela	Whoa!
	Robot Devil	[singing] Leela has promised me her hand.
	Leela	[singing] Fry, you do not understand.
	Leela	[singing] I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender,The shame,The shame,But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendour,Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender,He gave me mechanical ears,Effective though just a bit garish,In return without shedding a tear,I agreed that I'd give him my hand--
	Robot Devil	[singing] In marriage!
	Leela	What?
	Robot Devil	[singing] You'd give me your hand in marriage.
	Hermes	[singing] Is this really happening or just being staged?
	Prof. Farnsworth	[singing] It can't be real--
	Amy	[singing] Not if Leela is engaged.
	Leela	[singing] That isn't what I meant,That isn't what I signed.
	Robot Devil	[singing] You should have checked the wording in the fine... [He makes the contract larger.] Print.
	Leela	[reading] I'll give you my hand...
	Leela	and [singing] In marriage.
	Bender	[singing] The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,Now that is "irony".
	Robot Devil	[singing] I will marry her now and confine her to hell,How droll,How droll!Where Styx is a river,And not just a band,Though they'll play our reception if all goes as planned,Unless, Fry, you surrender my hands!
	Fry	[singing] Destiny has cheated me,By forcing me to decide upon,The woman that I idolise,Or the hands of an automaton,Without these hands I can't complete,The opera that was captivating her,But if I keep them,And she marries him,Then he probably won't want me dating her.
	Richard Nixon	Arooo!
	Zapp	Bray-vo! Enn-core!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[singing] I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
	Zoidberg	[singing] I can't believe everybody's just ad-libbing!
	Preacherbot	[singing] By the power vested in me,By the state of New New York--
	Fry	No! [He pushes the Robot Devil away from Leela.] Stop! Take my hands!(singing) You evil, metal dork!
	Hedonismbot	Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning to lose interest. [He turns to his servants.] Jombey! The chocolate icing! [One of the servants starts spreading chocolate icing over Hedonismbot's stomach. He giggles.] Oh! Oh, my!
	Fry	My hands. My horrible human hands. [He gasps.] And what did you do to my nails?
	Robot Devil	I cleaned them. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's my poker night and I feel lucky. [He giggles.] So it's back to hell for me. Come on, Nixon!
	Richard Nixon	Huh?
	Hedonismbot	Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera.
	Fry	But I can't play anymore.
	Zoidberg	[shouting] Yes you can! The beauty was in your heart, not your hands. [Fry picks the holophonor up and plays a bad tune. A crude holo-scene forms. A crude Holo-Fry and Holo-Leela walk out of some houses and stare at each other. The audience "boos".] The music's bad and you should feel bad.
	Fry	Whoa! Hey!
	Tinny Tim	[shouting] Extra! Extra! Greatest opera of all time sucks.
	Zoidberg	I'll take eight!
	Leela	Please don't stop playing, Fry. I wanna hear how it ends.
