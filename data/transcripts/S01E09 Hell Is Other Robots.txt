	Fry	This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
	Bender	Can I get anybody a beer?
	Fry	Sure!
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] Ladies and gentlemen, here to lay down some old, old, incredibly old school beats: The Beastie Boys!
	Beastie Boys	[singing] Well now don't you tell to smile,You stick around,,I'll make it worth your whileGot numbers beyond what you can dial,Maybe it's because I'm so versatile,Style profile I said,It always brings me back when I hear Wu Child...
	Leela	Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
	Bender	I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
	Fry	Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
	Beastie Boys	[singing] ...known for the Flintstone FlopTammy D gettin' biz on the crop,Beastie Boys know to let the beat...
	Mike	Drop! [His dancer drops him and his head flies off the stage. The crowd pass him over them.] Ow! How's it going? [They pass him again.] Enjoying the show? Ow! [They pass him again and he disappears into the crowd.] [shouting] Don't forget to pick up a T-shirt!
	Fry	Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on, guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999 ... again.
	Beastie Boys	[singing] Well it's 50 cups of coffee and you know it's onI move the crowd to the break of break of dawn...
	Leela	Ow! Hey, watch it!
	Fry	Man, these guys rock harder than ever!
	Mike	[singing] Oh, my...
	MCA	[singing] It's a mirage...
	Ad-Rock	[singing] Tellin' you all it's a...
	Beastie Boys	[singing] Sabotage!
	Ad-Rock	[singing] Sabotage, yeah!
	Mike	Peace, we out!
	Fender	Hey, Bender!
	Bender	Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?
	Fender	Not anymore, baby. I'm with the band!
	Mike	Aw! Oh, yeah!
	Fender	Hey, fellas, hey. I want you to meet my friends, Bender, Fry and Leela.
	Ad-Rock	Y'know, we're really not that interested in meeting them.
	Fry	Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums.
	Ad-Rock	That was a thousand years ago. Now we got seven.
	Fry	Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
	Fender	[whispering] Hey, Bender, why don't we ditch these organ sacks and hit the real party?
	Bender	Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!
	Bender	Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
	Fender	Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on! [He plugs himself into the machine and shocks himself.] Aw, yeah! [He takes the plug out and offers it to Bender.] Wanna jolt?
	Bender	Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?
	Robot	Counter indicated!
	Fender	Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool.
	Bender	Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!
	Fender	Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff.
	Bender	Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.
	Fry	Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
	Bender	Shut up, square! [Bender walks off the street down into a place called Sparky's Den. His shades fall off. His eyes are blue and electrified.] I'll just be a minute!
	Preacherbot	Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here ... [He takes out a 3.5" disk.] ... in The Good Book 3.0.
	Bender	Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
	Fry	Who was that guy?
	Bender	Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
	Hermes	Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
	Zoidberg	Me?
	Amy	Good morning, Bender.
	Bender	None of your business! Get off my back!
	Amy	What's his problem?
	Leela	If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
	Fry	Bender? No way! [The lights dim.] I definitely would've noticed something.
	Leela	Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?
	Bender	[from inside] No! Don't come in!
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!
	Bender	Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.
	Fry	I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
	Leela	Did he use his tongue?
	Fry	A little. [Leela cringes. Bender sits in the corner chewing his fingers.] You OK, Bender?
	Bender	None of your business! Get off my back!
	Leela	Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
	Bender	A what kind of disturbance?
	Leela	Electrical. Anyway, it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
	Leela	We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
	Fry	What's happening? I-I feel weird!
	Bender	Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! [Lightning strikes Bender's antenna and he jitters. Another bolt strikes him and a third. His legs melt.] Oh, mama!
	Bender	What?
	Leela	Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.
	Zoidberg	In fact, that's why we loved you.
	Leela	But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
	Fry	And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
	Bender	You're right. I'm a lost cause.
	Bender	Maybe there's another way.
	Bender	Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff. [The sign short circuits. Bender unplugs himself and cries.] [crying] What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?
	Preacherbot	I see a lot of fancy robots here today, made of real shiny metal. But that don't impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!
	Vergerbot	No, sir!
	Preacherbot	'Cause if you're a sinner, he's gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall, belchin' smoke and flame. And he's gonna download you straight to Robot Hell!
	Vergerbot	Straight to hell!
	Preacherbot	So I ask you: Who will stand up and be saved? Who? Who?
	Bender	[weakly] Me.
	Hermes	And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt-water cooler.
	Zoidberg	This is a witch hunt!
	Bender	[singing] Oh, what a beautiful morning,Oh what a beautiful day!(talking) Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?
	Fry	Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.
	Bender	No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.
	Fry	Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
	Leela	Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive.
	Professor Farnsworth	[simultaneous] Yes.
	Amy	[simultaneous] Oh, yeah.
	Hermes	[simultaneous] Oh, yes!
	Zoidberg	[simultaneous] Oh, yeah.
	Bender	Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!
	Preacherbot	We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold, steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation.
	Robot #2	Tell it, Preacher!
	Robot #3	That equals true.
	Preacherbot	Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell?
	Bender	Yes, I do.
	Preacherbot	Then I will now baptise you. [A keyboard appear from his waist.] Press any key to continue.
	Bender	Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?
	Leela	This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
	Bender	The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
	Waiter	Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
	Bender	No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil. [He drinks the oil.] Ah! Functional!
	Hermes	Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!
	Bender	Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? [The staff grumble. Bender closes his eyes.] In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic: 1000101010101...
	Bender	...0010110012. Amen.
	Fry	Does that mean we can eat now?
	Bender	Yes. [The crew tuck in.] But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!
	Fry	Oh, uh, but I don't want to.
	Bender	Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend! [Fry, unsure, pats Bender on the back. Bender stands up again.] Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls.
	Leela	What are you doing to my ship?
	Bender	Sanctifying it! [Leela sighs. Bender has stuck on a robot version of the Ichthus.] There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
	Fry	Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
	Leela	Amen.
	Professor Farnsworth	If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
	Fry	We've got to get the old Bender back.
	Leela	And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called "sleaze".
	Bender	I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
	Fry	Uh, this.
	Bender	Where are we delivering it to?
	Leela	Uh, here.
	Bender	Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
	Fry	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?
	Leela	Hey, great idea!
	Bender	But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
	Fry	Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.
	Bender	What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
	Leela	Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.
	Bender	Thou shalt not snatch.
	Fry	And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
	Hookerbot	Hey, sailing unit!
	Bender	Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
	Fry	Pfft! That's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.
	Leela	Go nuts.
	Hookerbot	Live a little.
	Woman	Could you hold my purse for a minute?
	Fry	Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!
	Bender	Well...
	Bender	I'm the greatest. [He opens the woman's purse and throws money into the air.] Woo-hoo!
	Fry	Look's like we got the old Bender back!
	Bender	You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.
	Bender	Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes. [The Fembots laugh. There is a knock at the door.] Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the "Do Not Disturb" sign? [He wraps a towel around his waist and opens the door. A red glows comes from the corridor. Bender gasps.] No! No!
	Robot Devil	Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot Hell.
	Leela	What in hell happened to Bender?
	Fry	Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here. [Nibbler yelps.] Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.
	Bender	I'm hallucinating this, right?
	Robot Devil	No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure.
	Bender	But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
	Robot Devil	Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when you joined our religion. If you sin you go to Robot Hel, for all eternity.
	Bender	Aw, hell-- I mean "heck"!
	Robot Devil	It's alright, you can say that here.
	Fry	Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
	Leela	Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
	Fry	Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.
	Leela	Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
	Fry	Actually--
	Robot Devil	We know all your sins, Bender. And for each one we've prepared an agonising and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?
	Bender	Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?
	Robot Devil	[singing] Cigars are evil,You won't miss 'em,We'll find ways to simulate that smell,What a sorry fella,Rolled up and smoked like a panetela,Here on level one of Robot Hell!
	Robot Devil	[singing] Gambling's wrong and so is cheating,So is forging phoney IOU's,Let's let Lady Luck decide,What type of torture's justified,I'm pit boss here on level two!
	Robot Devil	[talking] Ooh! Deep-fried robot!
	Bender	[singing] Just tell me why.
	Robot Devil	[singing] Please read this 55-page warrant.
	Bender	[singing] There must be robots worse than I.
	Robot Devil	[singing] We've checked around, there really aren't.
	Bender	[singing] Then please let me explain,My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.
	Robot Devil	[singing] You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!
	Bender	[singing] Ah, don't blame me,Blame my upbringing!
	Robot Devil	[singing] Please stop sinning while I'm singing!
	Robot Devil	[singing] Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,Musicians need that income to survive.
	Beastie Boys	[singing] Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on level five!
	Fry	[singing] I don't feel well.
	Leela	[singing] It's up to us to rescue him.
	Fry	[singing] Maybe he likes it here in Hell.
	Leela	[singing] It's us who tempted him to sin.
	Fry	[singing] Maybe he's back at the motel.
	Leela	[singing] Come on, Fry, don't be scared,I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,So just sit back, enjoy the ride.
	Fry	[singing] My ass has blisters from the slide.
	Robot Devil	[singing] Fencing diamonds,Fixing cockfights,Publishing indecent magazines,
	Robot Devil	You'll pay for every crime,Knee-deep in electric slime,You'll suffer till the end of time,Enduring torture's, most of which rhyme,Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!
	Robot Devil	[talking] Of course, that's just for starters.
	Fry	Bender, are you alright?
	Bender	No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
	Leela	Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?
	Robot Devil	Sorry, but I hold all the cards here. There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll just sign this fiddle contest waiver.
	Leela	Wait. What fiddle contest?
	Robot Devil	The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires me to inform you that if you can best me in a fiddle contest, you win back Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold fiddle.
	Fry	Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
	Robot Devil	Well it's mostly for show.
	Leela	[whispering] Do you know how to play the fiddle?
	Fry	[whispering] No. Do you?
	Leela	[whispering] No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar. [talking] What happens if we lose?
	Robot Devil	You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, him.
	Leela	We'll do it.
	Robot Devil	Very well, then. Beat this.
	Bender	Well, we're boned.
	Robot Devil	Your turn. [He hands the violin to Leela. She plays awfully. Fry and Bender cringe.] Ha!
	Leela	Time for the drum solo!
	Fry	Run!
	Robot Devil	Stop them! They cheated!
	Leela	Hurry, Bender!
	Bender	I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
	Leela	Oh, sorry.
	Bender	Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.
	Leela	Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.
	Bender	I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
	Fry	Good old Bender!
	Beastie Boys	Yeah, yeah! This one goes out to my man, Bender,Sending this one out, special dedication,To all my peoples in the robot homeworld,Yeah, yeah! Big up with the Professor,My man, Dr. Zoidberg,I'd like to shout out-- a personal shout out to Leela,Fry! My man, Bender,Nibber, Nibbler, in the house,Big shout out to all Futurama!
