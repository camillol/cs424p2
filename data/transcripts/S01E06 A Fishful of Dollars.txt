00:08	Fry	I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours! [He bangs on the wall.] (shouting) Give it a rest, you two!
00:20	Robot	[shouting] Sorry!
00:56	Teacher	Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam.
01:00	Fry	Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?
01:05	Teacher	Ancient Egyptian algebra.
01:08	Fry	What a nightmare!
01:09	Teacher	Mister Fry, are those your underpants? [Fry looks down and sees he is wearing only his briefs. He stands up and the whole class laughs and points. He gasps.] Young man, I think it's time you learned a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs.
01:22	Announcer	[voice-over] Lightspeed fits today's active lifestyle. Whether you're on the job ... [Fry suddenly appears in a company meeting wearing just Lightspeeds.] ... or having fun. [He sits with a woman on a bed.] Lightspeed briefs, style and comfort for the discriminating crotch.
01:33	Fry	What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
01:44	Fry	So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
01:47	Leela	Of course.
01:48	Fry	But, how is that possible?
01:49	Professor Farnsworth	It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg. [He holds up an egg and injects it with liquid. The egg explodes, covering him and Leela in yolk.] Although, in reality, it's not liquid, but gamma radiation.
02:00	Fry	That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
02:03	Leela	Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
02:05	Fry	Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games and on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and written in the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!
02:20	Bender	Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
02:24	Amy	Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running off to buy brand-name merchandise at low, low prices.
02:45	Perfume saleswoman	Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?
02:49	Amy	No thanks.
02:52	Perfume saleswoman	And you, sir?
02:53	Bender	No thanks. I--
02:59	Cosmetologist	What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye area.
03:13	Fry	Cool. [He walks over to a salesman.] Can I try these on before I buy them?
03:17	Salesman	I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the demo pair.
03:27	Fry	Ooh! Ho, ho, ho!
03:48	Amy	Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.
03:50	Bender	New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
04:00	Salesman	$30, please.
04:01	Fry	$30? I can't afford that. Unless... [He pulls out his wallet.] Do you take Visa?
04:06	Salesman	Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
04:08	Fry	American Express?
04:09	Salesman	600 years.
04:11	Fry	Discover card?
04:12	Salesman	Sorry we don't take Discover.
04:14	Amy	Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
04:17	Fry	No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?
04:23	Amy	Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
04:27	Mom	[on screen] Hello, shoppers. It's me, Mom!
04:29	Fry	Hey who's the rocker jockey?
04:31	Amy	Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
04:34	Mom	[on screen] Call me old-fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door, well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.
04:44	Bender	Mmm, tasty!
04:45	Mom	[on screen] And remember: Mom's oil is made with 10% more love than the next leading brand!
04:52	Announcer	[voice-over; on screen] "Mom", "love" and "screen door" are registered trademarks of Momcorp.
04:57	Fry	Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.
05:03	Bender	I'm boned.
05:04	Smitty	Freeze, scuzzbot!
05:05	Bender	Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here. [More tins fall out.] I'm sure there's-- [More tins fall out.] I say I'm sure there's-- [Even more tins fall out.] That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--
05:30	Amy	Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
05:33	Fry	[counting] 78, 79, 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.
05:38	Leela	I'd love to chip in but Bender stole my wallet.
05:43	Fry	Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.
05:51	Teller	Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your colonic map on file.
05:56	Fry	Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?
06:02	Teller	Do you still remember your PIN number?
06:03	Fry	Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.
06:09	Teller	OK, you had a balance of 93 cents...
06:12	Fry	Alright!
06:14	Teller	And at an average of two-and-a-quarter percent interest over a period of 1000 years, that comes to ... $4.3 billion.
06:29	Hermes	To Fry.
06:37	Amy	Cheers!
06:38	Leela	I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?
06:41	Bender	Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle.
07:13	Fry	Pizza dinner on me! [The others cheer.] Just keep the tab under $50 million.
07:18	Robot Chef	Yo! [He whistles.] I haven't got all day. What kind of pizza yous guys want?
07:22	Fry	Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!
07:30	Robot Chef	[mechanical voice] Invalid selection. (normal voice) Yo, what are you talking about?
07:33	Fry	Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
07:35	Robot Chef	[mechanical voice] Does not compute. Does not compute.
07:40	Professor Farnsworth	I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's.
07:45	Fry	What?
07:46	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?
07:52	Zoidberg	[defensively] I'm not on trial here.
07:53	Fry	So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and--
08:01	Zoidberg	Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying "One more can't hurt" and then they were gone. We're sorry!
08:10	Fry	I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
08:18	Bender	Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are. [He puts his monocle back on.] Huh? Huh?
08:31	Fry	So? What do you think?
08:34	Leela	I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. [She stamps the floorboards.] The floors are made of such hard wood.
08:39	Bender	Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
08:43	Fry	What's wrong with it?
08:44	Bender	Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.
08:50	Amy	That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo.
08:55	Leela	That's cute!
09:00	Auctioneer	Sold!
09:01	Fry	Yes!
09:02	Leela	I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson, and why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?
09:07	Fry	I have an idea for a sitcom.
09:09	Bender	Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.
09:14	Leela	You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
09:19	Bender	Yeah, it is cute.
09:24	Auctioneer	Now, our final item: This unopened can of Angry Norwegian brand anchovies circa 1997.
09:31	Fry	Anchovies?
09:32	Auctioneer	The last known can in existence guaranteed fresh and edible. Do I hear $10,000?
09:39	Fry	15,000!
09:40	Man	20!
09:41	Decapodian Woman	30! No, 40!
09:43	Fry	50,000!
09:46	Leela	Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
09:49	Fry	Don't tell me how to spend my money.
09:51	Auctioneer	50 going once, twice--
09:53	Mom	75,000.
09:57	Leela	Oh, my God! It's Mom! I've never seen her in person before.
10:01	Fry	100,000.
10:05	Leela	Fry, you can't bid against Mom; she's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable.
10:12	Mom	Well, I suppose I could go as high as ... 300,000.
10:16	Fry	500!
10:17	Mom	Oh, mercy be. A million.
10:18	Fry	Two.
10:19	Mom	Six.
10:20	Fry	14!
10:21	Mom	I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish. Nevertheless, I'll bid 23 million.
10:27	Fry	One jillion dollars.
10:30	Auctioneer	Sir, that's not a number.
10:33	Fry	Oh. In that case, 50 million.
10:38	Mom	Well, boys, your old mother knows when she's been beat. [She turns to Fry.] You win, young man. I tip my bonnet to you.
10:46	Bidder #1	Isn't she adorable?
10:47	Bidder #2	Isn't she sweet?
10:48	Auctioneer	What a class act! Sold! To the gentleman who bought every item in today's auction.
11:00	Fry	Now for some good old 20th century TV.
11:06	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] Do you remember a time when chocolate chip cookies came fresh from the oven? Petridge Farm remembers.
11:12	Fry	Ah, those were the days.
11:14	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] Do you remember a time when women couldn't vote and certain folk weren't allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.
11:21	Leela	[from outside] Fry? Are you there?
11:23	Fry	Eh?
11:25	Leela	You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
11:29	Fry	I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's eight o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!
11:43	Leela	You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
11:46	Fry	I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
11:49	Leela	Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past.
11:52	Fry	I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
11:54	Leela	But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
11:58	Bender	Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
12:05	Fry	Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things.
12:12	Bender	[sadly] I'm a thing.
12:13	Fry	Just leave me alone.
12:18	Leela	Fry, please-- [Fry slams the door and Leela knocks.] (from outside) My ponytail's caught in the door.
12:22	Fry	I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies.
12:35	Mom	Mercy me, what a day.
12:36	Mom	Could you shut the door, Igner, dear? I think I feel a draught coming on. [Igner closes the door and Mom's torso open up, revealing it to be just a body suit. A thinner but just as old a woman jumps out.] Holy crap, that bastard's itchy! [She snaps her fingers.] Walt! Cream soda!
12:49	Walt	Right away, mother. Larry, get your mother a cream soda.
12:52	Larry	But, Mom said--
12:53	Walt	You heard me.
13:02	Igner	What's wrong, Mommy?
13:04	Mom	It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, Fry, must know their secret. And I won't rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom!
13:24	Walt	Quiet, you!
13:29	Mom	As you boys know, one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil. Think of it: 10 billion robots, each one needing an oil change every 3000 miles. You don't have to do the math to know that's a buttload of oil.
13:45	Igner	Can I wear your fat suit?
13:46	Mom	[shouting] No, Igner, put that down!
13:49	Walt	What does this have to do with the anchovies?
13:51	Mom	I'm getting to the freaking anchovies. [She turns on a TV displaying an anchovy.] A single drop of the anchovies' natural oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.
14:00	Larry	Wow, it's a shame they went extinct.
14:02	Mom	[shouting] No, it isn't! Shut your filthy trap! [Walt slaps Larry.] (talking) Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got a hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of Third-World kids and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear, old Mom out of businness.
14:19	Walt	My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order.
14:29	Fred	[on TV] Esther, you ugly!
14:32	Mom	We have only one option: We'll have to bankrupt Mr. Fry, so he'll be forced to sell the anchovies to us.
14:37	Walt	Mother, you are one clever old skag!
14:40	Mom	And don't you forget it!
14:42	Larry	But how are we supposed to get Fry's money out of the bank?
14:44	Mom	That part will be easy, thanks to the nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance Unit.
14:51	Teller	[on TV] Do you still remember your PIN number?
14:52	Fry	[on TV] Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza. [The tape rewinds.] It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda--
14:58	Mom	You know what needs to be done.
15:04	Larry	What?
15:05	Mom	[shouting] Get his PIN number, you idiots! [She zips up her fat suit.] (talking) Now I'm off to some charity BS for knocked-up teenage sluts.
15:15	Walt	[from outside] Mr. Fry, it's those three plumbers you called for.
15:19	Larry	[from outside] We're here to tighten your drain.
15:25	Fry	I didn't order any--
15:27	Walt	Quick! Give him the tranquilliser.
15:32	Larry	That's a good boy.
15:39	Walt	Wake up, Mr. Fry.
15:41	Fry	Where am I?
15:42	Walt	You're in the good old year 2000, working here at Panucci's Pizza. You fell asleep on the job.
15:48	Fry	That sounds like me but I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
15:53	Walt	No, you only "dreamed" you were in the year 3000.
15:56	Fry	So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?
16:01	Walt	I'm Mr. Panucci.
16:03	Fry	You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
16:07	Walt	No. Now go work the currency register, I think I hear a customer coming. [No one enters.] I said, "I think I hear a customer coming"!
16:16	Anderson	Hurry up, please. I wanna get back to the Head Museum.
16:19	Larry	Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't take long. Now, your motivation is you're back in the year 2000 and your head's still on your body, and you want a cheese pizza.
16:31	Anderson	OK. But I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress.
16:37	Fry	Hey, look! Anchovies!
16:38	Walt	Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need further proof that this is really a thousand years ago, well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela Anderson!
16:51	Fry	Ooh!
16:53	Anderson	Hello, Fry. Remember me from Baywatch: The Movie?
16:56	Fry	Uh...
16:57	Anderson	It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow-motion.
17:01	Walt	[whispering] It hasn't been made yet.
17:02	Anderson	[whispering] Then he doesn't know I won the Oscar?
17:04	Walt	Nope.
17:05	Anderson	Crap!
17:06	Fry	Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
17:10	Anderson	Oh, I'll have a cheese pizza and a large ... uh ... line?
17:15	Larry	[whispering] Soda!
17:16	Anderson	Oh, right! Cheese pizza and a large soda!
17:20	Fry	Uh, cheese and a-- [Walt immediately picks up the boxed pizza and soda from under the counter.] That was quick!
17:24	Anderson	So. What do I owe you?
17:27	Fry	10.77. Same as my PIN number.
17:37	Igner	Hey! You don't get to laugh.
17:45	Igner	Thanks a billion!
17:46	Larry	More like 4.3 billion!
17:49	Igner	Ow!
17:50	Larry	Ow!
18:01	Fry	Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here.
18:08	Leela	Since when do you care about us?
18:10	Bender	We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
18:14	Fry	No, that's not true!
18:16	Leela	Goodbye-ee!
18:18	Bender	Whee!
18:21	Announcer	[voice-over] This dream brought to you by Lightspeed briefs.
18:24	Fry	Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy, what year is this?
18:31	Repo-bot	Uh, 3000.
18:33	Fry	3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful! [He sees what the repo-bot is carrying.] Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
18:40	Repo-bot	Uh, cheque bounced. We're taking it all back.
18:44	Fry	Oh, no! My ATM card! My secret PIN number -- 1077. I've got nothing left. Except...
18:55	Leela	You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
18:59	Professor Farnsworth	Uh, wha? Oh, yes! They say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of...
19:15	Fry	Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
19:17	Leela	You did? What happened?
19:19	Fry	I was robbed. They got everything except these.
19:22	Bender	Who did?
19:24	Mom	Hello, Fry.
19:25	Leela	It's Mom!
19:26	Mom	I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles and I thought maybe I could help out a sweet, young man by buying his anchovies.
19:34	Fry	Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
19:37	Mom	What? Listen, you little bastard. I control the robot oil business and I won't let you ruin me. How much do you want?
19:44	Fry	You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important: My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. [Bender and Leela look at each other.] That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like.
19:59	Mom	Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them all, you're a growing boy. Toodle-oo! [She walks out.] Dumb ass!
20:09	Fry	What a nice lady!
20:17	Fry	OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.
20:23	Amy	I don't know, I've had cow. [The staff tuck in. Everyone except Fry spits out their pizza.] Ew! Gross!
20:32	Fry	Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you.
20:37	Zoidberg	That stench. That heavenly stench! [He gobbles up the rest of the pizza.] More!
20:46	Fry	There aren't any more. And there never will be.
20:48	Zoidberg	More! More! More! More!
