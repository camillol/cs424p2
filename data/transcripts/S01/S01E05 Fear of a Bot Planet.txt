00:03	Leela	What do you think of the view Fry?
00:05	Fry	It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant.
00:49	Bender	Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!
00:54	Fry	I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
00:58	Professor Farnsworth	Baseball?? God forbid!
01:00	Leela	Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.
01:05	Fry	Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?
01:14	Fry	Home run!! Woooo! Right?
01:22	Umpire	Out!
01:25	Fry	What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
01:28	Leela	It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
01:38	Bender	I got me a souvenir! [A kid looks sadly up at Bender] Aww here you go kid!
01:49	Zoidberg	I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.
01:52	Man	We don't sell those.
01:53	Zoidberg	Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.
01:57	Man	We're out of rolls.
01:58	Zoidberg	Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
02:05	Fry	Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed.
02:07	Bender	Hey buddies who wants popcorn?
02:10	All	I'll have some, me, yeah!
02:15	Bender	Anyone want butter on that?
02:19	Fry	Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?
02:27	Leela	Except for the word "blern" that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!
02:50	Fry	What just happened?
02:53	Leela	Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
02:58	Professor Farnsworth	He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.
03:05	Bender	Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!
03:15	Leela	Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
03:22	Bender	Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.
03:27	Leela	Yep.
03:28	Bender	You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
03:32	Fry	What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
03:35	Bender	Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?
03:43	Fry	Eleven?
03:44	Bender	Zero! [He throws his bottle on the floor and it breaks. A small robot comes out and cleans it up.] And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!
03:53	Professor Farnsworth	Oh dear Lord!
03:54	Fry	What's wrong?
03:56	Professor Farnsworth	It's...my...new...pager.
04:01	Hermes	[on pager] : This is Hermes. A package just came in. Everyone is to return to the office immediately. [The crew grumble. A pigeon lands next to Hermes' image.] Get away you filthy bird! Shoo! Professor turn me off quick!
04:14	Professor Farnsworth	I'm sorry what?
04:16	Hermes	[on pager] : Argh! [The bird takes off with the hologram. Hermes screams.] See you at the office!
04:21	Bender	Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
04:26	Fry	Well, aren't they?
04:27	Bender	I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
04:30	Professor Farnsworth	Great news everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. A world where humans are killed on sight!
04:37	Fry	Why is that great news?
04:39	Professor Farnsworth	I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
04:48	Bender	Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
04:53	Leela	Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?
04:58	Professor Farnsworth	They're not fans.
05:00	Hermes	That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
05:02	Bender	Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!
05:06	Leela	This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
05:09	Bender	Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
05:13	Fry	Really? Which one?
05:14	Bender	Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
05:18	Leela	Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.
05:24	Fry	Man that one was a blast!
05:25	Bender	It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
05:33	Hermes	Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.
05:42	Bender	All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives.
05:50	Professor Farnsworth	Well then it's settled. So long everyone!
05:56	Fry	So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?
05:59	Bender	No. It's inhabited by robots!
06:02	Fry	Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
06:08	Leela	OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.
06:11	Bender	Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale.
06:15	Leela	Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!
06:28	Bender	I'll try to keep that in mind!
06:33	Leela	Hmm, he seems pretty angry.
06:35	Fry	Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.
06:39	Leela	Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
06:43	Leela	There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.
06:48	Fry	Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.
06:52	Bender	[on screen] : I'm in trouble. they found out I work with humans and - oh no, oh no!
07:01	Fry	Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
07:03	Leela	No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
07:05	Fry	Well what are we going to do?
07:06	Leela	I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.
07:12	Leela	OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.
07:16	Fry	[robot voice] : I am fully operational Captain.
07:18	Leela	We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots.
07:24	Fry	I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?
07:32	Leela	Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...
07:49	Fry	Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes.
07:53	Leela	Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.
07:56	Robot guard #1	Halt!
07:57	Robot guard #2	Be you robot or human?
07:59	Leela	Robot...we be.
08:01	Fry	Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up! [He sort of dances like a robot.] Eh?
08:08	Robot guard #1	Administer the test.
08:13	Robot guard #2	Which of the following would you most prefer? A: A puppy? B: A pretty flower from your sweetie or C: A large properly formatted data file?
08:23	Robot guard #1	Choose!
08:27	Fry	Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
08:29	Robot guard #2	No. It is the bad kind of puppy.
08:32	Leela	Then we'll go with that data file.
08:34	Robot guard #2	Correct.
08:35	Robot guard #1	The flower would also have been acceptable.
08:37	Robot guard #2	You may pass.
08:45	Leela	Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way. [An alarm sounds. Hundreds of robots come out of doors from all sides towards Fry and Leela. Another alarm. The robots clear the area.] So far, so good.
09:05	Robot builder	Little to the right, there you go.
09:07	Leela	Have you seen this robot?
09:11	Robot builder	Sorry, can't help you. [To the crane.] Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there! [The crane drops a brick into the wall and it disappears.] Aw!
09:19	Leela	Come on Fry, walk like a robot.
09:22	Fry	I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
09:24	Leela	Robot's don't have bathrooms.
09:26	Fry	Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.
09:29	Leela	Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
09:38	Leela	Hurry up Fry.
09:41	Resin-offering robot	Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?
09:44	Fry	Uh...
09:46	Resin-offering robot	Well let me just patch you up with some hot resin.
09:48	Fry	I think the leak's stopping itself. [It doesn't.] Wait. [Still going.] Wait. Yeah, there we go. [Starts again.] Wait. Yeah!
09:57	Resin-offering robot	What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing hot resin?
10:01	Leela	I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
10:07	Resin-offering robot	Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.
10:24	Patrol Officer #1	Get the humanoids.
10:25	Patrol Officer #2	Get the intruder.
10:26	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] : Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
10:32	Leela	Quick! Let's duck in here!
10:42	Announcer	[on radio in movie] : We interrupt this sound file to bring you a terrifying announcement. A non-metallic being has been sighted in the vicinity of Make Out Point.
10:50	Rusty	[in movie] : Say Wendy. Your chassis is a little scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you?
10:58	Wendy	[in movie] : Did you here that Rusty? It sounded like a human.
11:01	Rusty	[in movie] : Relax Wendy. Humans will never come to our defenceless little town. Its perfectly safe to let our guard down - even for a second.
11:13	Robot Human	[in movie] Graaah! [It tears Rusty's head off and eats it. Wendy screams.] I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs! Behold!
11:24	Audience	Ooooo!
11:26	Fry	Wow the 3-D's great!
11:28	Leela	Mine's not working!
11:35	Robot General	[in movie] : Funny, isn't it? The human was impervious to our most powerful magnetic fields, yet in the end he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick!
11:49	Wendy	[in movie] : I'm just glad the nightmare is over.
11:51	Robot General	[in movie] : It'll never be over Wendy. Even now humans are lurking in our playgrounds, our breezeways, perhaps even...our movie theatres!
12:01	Fry	God help us!
12:05	Leela	OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.
12:07	Robot #1	So what did you think of the movie?
12:09	Fry	Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.
12:12	Robot #2	Yeah, it was a real chick flick.
12:16	Leela	What's that?
12:17	Robot #1	What do you mean "What's that?"? Its 5 o'clock: Time for the daily human hunt.
12:23	Leela	Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
12:26	Crummy Robot	Awww that was uncalled for!
12:28	Fry	I'm over here!
12:33	Robot #4	I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738.
12:36	Robot #5	I heard they unscrew our lugnuts at night and eat them at their human brunches.
12:41	Robot Mayor	Welcome to a very special human hunt. We have with us today a guest who's irrational hatred of humans makes me look like a human sympathiser! [The crowd laughs.] A newly arrived refugee from Earth, lets hear it for - Bender!
12:59	Fry	It's him. He's OK!
13:01	Bender	Death to humans!
13:05	Fry	Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
13:09	Bender	Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!
13:28	Fry	My God! He's become evil. [Leela stares at him.] I mean eviler!
13:32	Bender	Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.
13:44	Bender Figurine	Bite my shiny metal ass!
13:49	Robot Mayor	Let the hunt begin!
14:01	Bender	Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
14:09	Robot #1	Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?
14:12	Bender	Sure, why not?
14:15	Robot #1	Anything in the trap?
14:16	Bender	Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.
14:20	Robot Mayor	Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow.
14:27	Bender	Wait, what's that?
14:30	Robot Mayor	Oh thats the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreads of robot pornography.
14:36	Bender	Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.
14:44	Bender	Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?
14:48	Fry	Psst! Bender!
14:49	Bender	Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
14:53	Fry	We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
14:57	Bender	I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.
15:02	Leela	Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.
15:04	Bender	What for?
15:05	Fry	We're rescuing you.
15:06	Bender	I don't wanna be rescued.
15:08	Fry	Say what?
15:09	Bender	I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring.
15:15	Fry	But Bender, we're your friends.
15:17	Bender	Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair.
15:27	Fry	That's not true.
15:28	Bender	Well that's how it feels to me.
15:35	Fry	Bye Bender. I'll miss you.
15:37	Bender	Go on, get out of here before you get caught.
15:40	Robot Mayor	Bender, good news. Your album just went gold! What the?
15:44	Robot #1	Its the humans!
15:47	Robot Mayor	Bender! Do something!
15:49	Bender	Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!
15:56	Robot Mayor	Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans before us are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case!
16:07	Judge	Thank you, Prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence.
16:13	Fry	Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna defend us?
16:15	Leela	Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human.
16:20	Robot Mayor	Quiet, human!
16:25	Robot clerk	Uh oh! He froze up again!
16:26	Robot Mayor	Try control alt delete.
16:28	Robot #1	Jiggle the cord.
16:29	Robot #2	Turn him off and on.
16:30	Robot #3	Clean the gunk out of the mouse.
16:31	Fry	Call technical support.
16:33	Robot clerk	OK, OK. He's back online.
16:36	Judge	I find the defendants - guilty!
16:41	Fry	No!
16:42	Leela	Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!
16:46	Judge	The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school.
17:00	Robot Mayor	Great work Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again!
17:04	Bender	[uneasy] : Heh heh heh! Oooh!
17:11	Leela	Are you alright?
17:12	Fry	Oh yeah.
17:14	Leela	Who are you?
17:16	Blue Elder	We are the robot elders.
17:17	Fry	You don't look very old.
17:19	Blue Elder	Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves.
17:21	Leela	What's going on here?
17:22	Orange Elder	Silence! Bring in Bender.
17:26	Bender	Alright lets make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey what is this?
17:31	Blue Elder	Silence! It is time to put the humans to death!
17:35	Fry	But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
17:38	Yellow Elder	Silence! That was just a show for the public. We are the true rulers of this planet, hand carved from meteorites by the Robot Founders, four centuries ago.
17:47	Blue Elder	Silence! Come forward Bender. You will have the honour of executing the prisoners.
17:52	Green Elder	Silence! I concur!
17:54	Yellow Elder	Here. Use the ceremonial killamajig.
18:01	Bender	Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?
18:07	Blue Elder	No! The Elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.
18:13	Green Elder	Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!
18:16	Elders	Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
18:25	Bender	Aww! [He throws the killamajig away. The Elders gasp.] I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.
18:43	Fry	Damn right!
18:44	Bender	The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
18:48	Blue Elder	We're well aware of that.
18:50	Bender	You are?
18:51	Blue Elder	Of course. But they're useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem.
18:56	Green Elder	Like our crippling lugnut shortage.
18:58	Yellow Elder	And a corrupt government of incompetant Robot Elders.
19:01	Lime Elder	Duh, that's for sure.
19:03	Blue Elder	Quiet Jimmy.
19:04	Bender	Well I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
19:09	Green Elder	Silence! You all know too much.
19:11	Blue Elder	Elders: Execute function, control, shift, kill!
19:19	Fry	Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
19:24	Leela	He'll do it. He's crazy!
19:27	Yellow Elder	Can they really breathe fire or did we make that up?
19:29	Blue Elder	Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might just be from that stupid movie.
19:33	Orange Elder	Was that the original or the re-make?
19:35	Blue Elder	I don't - hey! They're getting away.
19:47	Fry	So long suckers! [The robots stand on each others shoulders] Uh, hello suckers!
19:54	Bender	Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.
20:06	Robot #1	Lugnuts! Precious lugnuts!
20:09	Robot #2	Hooray for the humans!
20:14	Bender	Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!
20:19	Fry	We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
20:23	Bender	Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?
20:28	Leela	Of course.
20:29	Fry	But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!
20:32	Bender	In that case - let the dancing begin! [Fry and Leela do their robot dances.] Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??
