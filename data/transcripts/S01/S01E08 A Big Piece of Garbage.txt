	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet.
	Hermes	Why can't they go today?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium.
	Fry	Wow! I love symposia.
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
	Bender	Sounds boring.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock. [He places a small black box on top on the table.] Simply jam your finger in the hole and this read-out tells you exactly how long you have left to live.
	Leela	Does it really work?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
	Fry	Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
	Bender	Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, my, yes.
	Fry	Who's the gross nerd?
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me.
	Wernstrom	Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?
	Wernstrom	Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science to the 120-year-olds.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
	Wernstrom	Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies.
	Fry	Who's that jerk?
	Prof. Farnsworth	A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then, after one fateful pop-quiz...
	Wernstrom	A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm sorry, but penmanship counts.
	Wernstrom	I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.
	Prof. Farnsworth	And here it is: Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I'm essentially in the clear.
	Bender	I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Part√© and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
	Waiter	Exquisite choices, sir.
	Bender	And mix them all together in a big jug.
	Popeil	Welcome to this year's Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium. I'm your host, Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and, of course, the technology to keep human heads alive in jars. [A few people applaud.] But wait, there's more. We've got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with that up and coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom.
	Bender	[shouting] More wine!
	Wernstrom	Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse Scuba Suit. Observe! [He waves a stick in front of a fish in a tank.] Fetch! [He throws the stick across the platform and his fish puts on the suit, which has two little mechanical legs. The fish gets out of the tank, walks across the stage, picks up the stick and hands it to Wernstrom.] Now, sit! [The fish doesn't do anything.] I said sit! [Still nothing.] Bad fish!
	Fry	Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.
	Wernstrom	And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
	Wernstrom	I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last year.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Uh, last year, you say?
	Wernstrom	That's right.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?
	Wernstrom	Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock.
	Leela	Uh, Professor...?
	Popeil	Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. Professor?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Just a second, just a second.
	Wernstrom	Pencils down, prune-face.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention ... the Smellescope.
	Man	Oh, I say!
	Prof. Farnsworth	The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a doodle of myself as a cowboy. [The audience laughs.] But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me. [The audience laughs again. Farnsworth wipes his brow with the paper.] Oh, my!
	Wernstrom	I've waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention the worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.
	Popeil	And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
	Bender	Yep!
	Fry	No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!
	Prof. Farnsworth	By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Eureka!
	Fry	Did you build the Smellescope?
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead, try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.
	Fry	Smells like strawberries.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Exactly! And now Saturn.
	Fry	Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.
	Leela	I don't get it.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.
	Fry	Oh. What's it called now?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.
	Fry	No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here! [He points the Smellescope around the sky and sniffs.] Hmm. [He sniffs again.] Hmm.
	Prof. Farnsworth	What is it? [He sniffs and reacts.] Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the Funk-o-Meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe.
	Bender	Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!
	Leela	I think it's moving.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hmm. Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory. [He clicks a few buttons.] My God! Whatever it is, it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours.
	Bender	Well, let's get looting!
	Fry	So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city? [A hologram of the object hits the hologram of the Earth with a splat.] What the heck is it?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] New York City: The year 2000. The most wasteful society in the history of the galaxy and it was running out of places to empty its never-ending output of garbage. [People throw black bags full of rubbish out of office windows and they are bulldozed away.] The landfills were full. New Jersey was full. And so, under cover of darkness, the city put its garbage out to sea on the world's largest barge. [A man resembling Rudy Giuliani unties a barge filled with garbage and pushes it away from the pier.] The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it, not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space. Some experts claim the ball might return to Earth someday, but their concerns were dismissed as "depressing".
	Fry	Wow! You got that off the Internet? In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Actually that's still true.
	Female Scientist	[in movie] Now that the garbage is in space, doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions.
	Male Scientist	[in movie] With gusto!
	Prof. Farnsworth	So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage.
	Leela	Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?
	Fry	Hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?
	Leela	We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
	Bender	Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
	Leela	And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches. [Fry looks inside the sandwich and cringes.] Nothing just gets thrown away.
	Fry	The future is disgusting.
	Leela	Typical 20th century attitude.
	Fry	Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.
	Leela	Those things are all from the 19th century.
	Fry	Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming or second-hand smoke. [He presses the intercom.] Send in my science advisor.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wernstrom!
	Wernstrom	Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Hey! Holy jeez!
	Wernstrom	That smell could be anything; a faulty stench coil, some cheese on the lens, who knows?
	Woman	Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune.
	Man	[on tape] Giant ... garbage ball ... [A gasp.] ... passed close by ... horrible stench.
	Woman	The transmission cuts out there, sir. [The voice chokes again.] No, I, guess it keeps going.
	Woman	There we go.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	My God! The senile old man is right.
	Wernstrom	Do you mean him or me?
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Him!
	Linda	[on TV] Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?
	Morbo	[on TV] Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York.
	Linda	[on TV] Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.
	Morbo	[on TV] Morbo agrees!
	Leela	Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
	Military Man	We've simulated that on a supercomputer but the ball is just too damn gooey. A missile would go right through it.
	Prof. Farnsworth	But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
	Military Man	In theory, it could work.
	Wernstrom	Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidally dangerous.
	Bender	Oh, crap!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions.
	Bender	[ironic] Oh, boo-hoo!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away.
	Leela	That's all? But--
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return.
	Leela	Odour at magnitude 8. [The ship shakes.] Magnitude 12. [The ship shakes.] Magnitude 31. [The ship shakes.] We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
	Fry	Hmm, sporty!
	Fry	Wow!
	Leela	Look at all this filth.
	Fry	It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century. [He picks up something.] Look! A real Beanie Baby. [He picks up something else.] Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate! [He sees something and gasps.] Some Bart Simpson dolls!
	Doll	Eat my shorts!
	Bender	OK [He eats the shorts.] [¬¥ la Homer Simpson] Mmm! Shorts!
	Leela	Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!
	Fry	This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
	Fry	[gasping] Alright, let's get to work.
	Leela	Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here. [She puts the bomb in the ground.] Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. [She presses the button and the timer changes to 15:00.] Uh, 15 minutes. [The timer changes again to 05:00.] 5 minutes. [The timer changes again to a very odd number.] "6h" minutes?
	Bender	There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
	Leela	That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.
	Fry	We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
	Bender	Right!
	Bender	It's gonna blow!
	Leela	Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!
	Bender	OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.
	Fry	We're saved!
	Leela	Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for.
	Linda	[on TV] All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!
	Morbo	[on TV] Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is doomed. Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior brain.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely. [He pulls out the manual from his coat. It is upside-down.] I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault.
	Fry	No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can. [Poopenmeyer cringes.] Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist in charge.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wernstrom!
	Wernstrom	The very same.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?
	Wernstrom	Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Done.
	Wernstrom	And a big research grant.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	You got it.
	Wernstrom	Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of them Chinese.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Um, alright done. What's your plan?
	Wernstrom	What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!
	Leela	That rat! Do something!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	I wish I could but he's got tenure!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	It's time to take action. [He presses the intercom.] Stephanie, cancel the maid for today. Have her come tomorrow. [He leans back into his chair.] Well, I'm out of ideas. Anyone?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits.
	Leela	But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Alas, I don't know.
	Fry	Uh, what about garbage?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan. This city's been garbage-free for 500 years!
	Fry	Then it's time to make some more.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Make garbage? But how?
	Fry	Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can. [He knocks it on the floor.] Now it's garbage. These papers. [He sweeps them off the desk with his hands.] Garbage. This picture of your wife. [He drops it on the floor and the frame smashes.] Pure garbage. Now you try it.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate of the city is at stake!
	Fry	Good! [He turns to Leela.] Don't finish that cruller, throw it away [Leela throws it on the floor.] Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground. [Bender throws the bottle on the floor.] Very nice.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Get that robot some more beer! [Bender smiles.] We've trashed this room but that's just the start. We've got to get Fry's message to the people.
	Fry	[on TV] People of New New York, take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
	Fry	[on TV] Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
	Prof. Farnsworth	If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun.
	Wernstrom	And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six...
	Leela	[whispering] Just fire the damn thing.
	Fry	Oops!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Burning garbage!
	Fry	It worked!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I now present you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom after it became apparent that he was a jackass.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!
	Wernstrom	I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt as well. If not for your 20th century garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried under 20th century garbage.
	Leela	Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?
	Fry	Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Exactly! It's none of our concern.
	Fry	That's the 20th century spirit!
