00:07	Fry	[voice-over] Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.
00:20	Fry	And that's how you play the game!
00:22	Boy	You stink, loser!
00:24	Mr. Panucci	Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out! C'mon!!
00:38	Fry	Michelle, baby! Where you going?
00:41	Michelle	It's not working out, Fry. [Next to her is a guy with his arm around her. The cab pulls away.] [shouting; from cab] I put your stuff out on the sidewalk!
00:46	Fry	I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life.
00:58	Bike Thief	Happy new year!
01:17	Fry	Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... [He reads the delivery note.] ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls! [He sits down on the chair, puts his feet on the desk and opens a can of beer.] Here's to another lousy millennium.
01:36	Crowd	[chanting] Ten!
01:37	Crowd	[chanting] Neuf!
01:38	Crowd	[chanting] Otto!
01:39	Crowd	[chanting] Saba!
01:40	Crowd	[chanting] Eksi!
01:41	Crowd	[chanting] Wu!
01:43	Crowd	[chanting] Cha!
01:44	Crowd	[chanting] Thathu!
01:45	Crowd	[chanting] Nee!
01:46	Crowd	[chanting] One!
01:55	Fry	What the--?
02:46	Fry	My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend; I'll never see any of them again. Yahoo!
03:32	Terry	[melodramatically] Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
03:36	Lou	Why do you always have to say it that way?
03:38	Terry	Haven't you ever heard of a little thing called showmanship? [He turns to Fry.] [dramatically] Come, your destiny awaits!
03:47	Lou	Have a nice future.
03:50	Fry	Cool! Just like in Star Trek! [The door closes on his head.] Ow!
03:53	Leela	Good afternoon, sir. [Fry is impressed with what he sees. Leela turns around. She has one huge eye in the middle of her face. Fry screams.] Name?
03:59	Fry	Uh, Fry.
04:01	Leela	I'm Leela. Now, it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get out of here.
04:05	Fry	Can I ask you a question?
04:07	Leela	As long as it's not about my eye.
04:09	Fry	Uh...
04:10	Leela	Is it about my eye?
04:11	Fry	Sort of.
04:13	Leela	Just ask the question.
04:15	Fry	What's with the eye?
04:16	Leela	I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject.
04:19	Fry	Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?
04:22	Leela	No, I just work here.
04:27	Fry	Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
04:30	Leela	Yep. It's December 31st, 2999.
04:33	Fry	My God! A million years!
04:37	Leela	I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
04:39	Fry	Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
04:52	Leela	Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator.
05:06	Leela	Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great-great-great-great-great-great-great...
05:12	Leela	...great-great-great-great-great nephew.
05:14	Fry	That's great! What's the little guy's name?
05:16	Leela	Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
05:19	Fry	Eurgh!
05:21	Fry	Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser. [A buzzer buzzes.] What's that?
05:30	Leela	Your permanent career assignment.
05:33	Fry	Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
05:37	Leela	Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
05:41	Fry	What if I refuse?
05:43	Leela	Then you'll be fired--
05:44	Fry	Fine!
05:45	Leela	Out of a cannon into the Sun!
05:47	Fry	But I don't like being a delivery boy.
05:49	Leela	Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. [She points at a poster of a man wearing a hardhat with the caption "You Gotta Do What You Gotta Do".] You gotta do what you gotta do. Now hold out your hand. I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.
06:03	Fry	Keep that thing away from me!
06:11	Leela	Hold still, dammit. I don't have good depth perception! [She jumps at Fry, misses, and falls into a cryogenic freezer. It sets itself for 1000 years.] You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One--
06:25	Fry	See you in a thousand years! [He starts to walk out but hesitates. He walks back and changes the freeze time to five minutes.] You owe me one.
06:48	Fry	Whoa!
	Man #1	JFK Jr. Airport.
07:07	Man #1	Radio City Mutant Hall.
07:10	Fry	Cool! [He steps into the tube.] Um. Cross Town Express?
07:38	Man #2	Pft! Tourist!
07:45	Fry	Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. [An impatient robot joins the queue behind him. It is more or less human-shaped, grey, with an antenna on top of it's head.] Wow! A real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
07:57	Bender	Bite my shiny metal ass.
07:59	Fry	It doesn't look so shiny to me.
08:01	Bender	Shinier than yours, meatbag!
08:21	Bender	Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a two-fer!
08:28	Booth Voice	Please select mode of death: "Quick and Painless" or "Slow and Horrible".
08:34	Fry	Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.
08:36	Booth Voice	You have selected: "Slow and Horrible".
08:39	Bender	Great choice! [Knives, tasers and Jacob's Ladders come out from behind a hatch.] Bring it on, baby!
08:50	Bender	C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!
08:55	Fry	Help! What's happening?
09:02	Booth Voice	You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide booth since 2008.
09:10	Bender	Lousy, stinking rip-off! [He kicks the booth.] Well, I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!
09:22	Leela	Two, three-- Hey!
09:25	Terry	[melodramatically] Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
09:28	Leela	Shut up, Terry.
09:30	Ipgee	This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip.
09:35	Leela	Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.
09:40	Ipgee	Well that's your job, whether you like it or not. And it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not, which I do, very much! Now get to work! [Leela leaves. He puts his feet up on the desk.] Life is good!
10:02	Fry	Why would a robot need to drink?
10:04	Bender	I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want! [He belches fire.] So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
10:14	Fry	Really? What do you do, Bender?
10:16	Bender	I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
10:19	Fry	You any good at it?
10:21	Bender	You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! [unsure] 31. [normal] But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.
10:35	Fry	What?
10:36	Bender	Suicide booths! [He finishes his drink and swallows the bottle.] Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself.
10:43	Fry	Wait! You're the only friend I have!
10:46	Bender	You really want a robot for a friend?
10:49	Fry	Yeah, ever since I was six.
10:51	Bender	Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger.
10:59	Fry	Oh, no, it's the Cyclops! [He crouches down behind Bender.] Don't look! Don't look!
11:03	Bender	I'm not looking!
11:11	Leela	This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
11:15	Smitty	We'll be there in five minutes.
11:20	Bender	We can hide in here. It's free on Tuesdays!
11:29	Nimoy	Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard Nimoy.
11:33	Fry	Spock? Hey! Do the thing!
11:36	Nimoy	I don't do that anymore.
11:38	Fry	This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
11:42	Nimoy	We share our wisdom with those who seek it. It's a life of quiet dignity.
11:47	Woman	Feeding time!
11:58	Leela	Hmm. [She looks around and sees Fry and Bender hiding behind a shelf in amongst other assorted heads.] I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip.
12:10	Fry	Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?
12:12	Leela	It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do! [Fry backs away and hits a shelf with the heads of US presidents on it.] Watch it!
12:22	Richard Nixon	That's it! You just made my list!
12:26	Fry	Ow! Stop it! Down, boy! Bad president!
12:29	Smitty	Alright, buddy, step away from the head!
12:34	URL	I'm gonna get 24th century on his ass!
12:41	Leela	Please, officers, there's no need to use force.
12:45	URL	Let us handle this, weird-y.
12:49	Leela	Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.
12:53	Smitty	Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!
12:56	Leela	No-one makes fun of my nose.
13:09	URL	Damn!
13:10	Leela	You guys were totally out of control.
13:12	Smitty	It's our job. We're peace officers.
13:15	URL	Yeah, you know the law: You gotta do what you gotta do.
13:22	Bender	Oh, we're trapped!
13:27	Fry	Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.
13:32	Bender	Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?
13:38	Fry	Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
13:43	Bender	I'll have to check my program ... yep.
13:46	Leela	[from outside] Open up!
13:48	Fry	C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots.
13:56	Bender	You're full of crap, Fry! [He turns and a dangling wire catches on his antenna and electrocutes him.] You make a persuasive argument, Fry.
14:09	Fry	Come on, Bender! You can do it.
14:11	Bender	Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
14:16	Fry	Yes!
14:18	Bender	You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!
14:36	Fry	I don't know how you did that.
14:44	Leela	Wait!
14:45	Bender	[shouting] No, thanks.
14:51	Bender	Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
15:05	Fry	Good Lord! What is this?
15:08	Bender	It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!
15:15	Fry	It's my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.
15:20	Bender	Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!
15:23	Fry	This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
15:35	Fry	My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
15:40	Bender	Wait! There's someone you know!
15:43	Fry	Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
15:47	Leela	Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
15:52	Fry	No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--
15:55	Bender	No friends.
15:56	Fry	My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
16:02	Leela	I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
16:17	Fry	Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it. [He holds out his hand to Leela. She gets the implant gun ready. Fry cringes and looks away. The gun clicks but Fry feels nothing. He opens his eyes and sees Leela drop her own chip on the floor.] Your chip. What are you doing?
16:37	Leela	Quitting.
16:38	Fry	Why?
16:39	Leela	Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
16:48	Fry	What is the matter with you?
16:51	Bender	I just wanted to be part of the moment.
16:53	Leela	Hey! He stole my ring!
16:55	Bender	Sorry. [He hands Leela's ring back.] Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
17:03	Leela	I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
17:09	Fry	Correction: We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
17:18	Clark	[on TV] Hello, I'm Dick Clark's head. Welcome to a special year 3000 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve!
17:30	Prof. Farnsworth	Who are you?
17:31	Fry	I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
17:33	Prof. Farnsworth	I don't have an Uncle Fry.
17:35	Bender	You do now!
17:40	Prof. Farnsworth	By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!
17:45	Bender	Can we have some money?
17:47	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, my, no.
17:50	Prof. Farnsworth	Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! [He points in the general direction of a big green spaceship in a huge hangar next to the lab.] And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
18:02	Fry	Whoa! A real live spaceship!
18:05	Prof. Farnsworth	I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
18:12	Smitty	[from outside] Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded.
18:18	Fry	No!
18:20	Richard Nixon	Get those bums!
18:22	Bender	Well, we're boned!
18:24	Leela	Can't we get away in the ship?
18:26	Prof. Farnsworth	I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
18:37	Fry	I'll get us out of here.
18:44	Prof. Farnsworth	Can anyone drive stick?
18:46	Leela	I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
18:57	URL	If they try to take off, give 'em an ass-ful of laser.
19:04	Leela	Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
19:06	Crowd	[chanting] Nine!
19:07	Crowd	[chanting] Amania!
19:09	Crowd	[chanting] Seven!
19:10	Aliens	[chanting; in alien] Six.
19:11	Terry	[dramatically] Five!
19:13	Nimoy	Four.
19:14	Prof. Farnsworth	Three.
19:15	Bender	Two.
19:16	Leela	One!
19:17	Fry	Blast-off!
19:26	Richard Nixon	Fire! Fire!
19:30	Smitty	I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
19:44	Fry	So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
19:47	Prof. Farnsworth	Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?
19:54	Bender	New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
19:57	Prof. Farnsworth	Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
20:03	Fry	Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
20:08	Leela	Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.
20:12	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew.
20:20	Fry	This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
20:26	Prof. Farnsworth	If by that you mean "transporting cargo" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.
20:34	Fry	Cool! What's my job gonna be?
20:36	Prof. Farnsworth	You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
20:41	Fry	So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?
20:44	Prof. Farnsworth	Exactly!
20:46	Fry	Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
