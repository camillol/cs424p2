00:39	Bender	Hey!
00:44	Hermes	Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work.
00:48	Fry	I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
00:54	Hermes	Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point one, then race forward--
01:08	Hermes	Concerning our pest problem: Somebody's been leaving food around and it's attracting owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps. [A trap snaps and an owl hoots.] Now... [He flicks a button and a graph appears on the big screen. It is a straight line that inclines ever so slightly at the end.] As this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has tripled in the last month. I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I'm appointing him head of a committee to find who's responsible. Fry? [Fry doesn't answer. He is taking a shower in the Emergency Chemical Burn Shower.] Am I cracking up, or is Fry's living here starting to get in the way of bus--
01:49	Leela	What the hell are you doing? You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
01:53	Fry	[pointing to his hair] And great lift!
01:55	Leela	Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
01:58	Fry	Hey! When you look this good, you don't have to know anything.
02:03	Leela	Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.
02:05	Bender	That's right, we want some money— Wait. What's this about Fry?
02:08	Leela	He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
02:12	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. [He picks a small box and opens it. It is empty.] This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago.
02:28	Fry	Hey, Professor, great jerky!
02:33	Prof. Farnsworth	My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!
02:42	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] Bachelor Chow, now with flavour!
02:45	Commentator	[voice-over; on TV] And Bigfoot is down!
02:47	Fry	Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.
02:52	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] All My Circuits is brought to you by Robo Fresh: Designed by a robot, for a robot.
03:01	Calculon	[on TV] I've been processing this for some time, Monique, and, well, will you marry me?
03:06	Monique	[on TV] Oh, Calculon! [They kiss. Calculon takes out a ring box, opens it, takes out a nut and screws it onto Monique's finger.] It fits! Then you must know that I'm--
03:19	Calculon	[on TV] Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.
03:29	Fry	Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.
03:31	Bender	Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.
03:33	Leela	We've all talked it over and--
03:35	Bender	Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.
03:41	Leela	Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it.
03:46	Fry	I know but I forgive you.
03:48	Leela	No, Fry, by "close quarters" I mean this office--
03:51	Fry	Uh-huh.
03:52	Leela	And by "people" I mean you!
03:53	Fry	Right.
03:54	Leela	And by "inconsiderate" I mean--
03:56	Fry	Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
03:58	Bender	Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?
04:03	Fry	So, who's that weird-looking guy?
04:04	Bender	That's a human.
04:05	Fry	What's he do?
04:06	Bender	Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.
04:10	Fry	Boring!
04:13	Human Friend	[on TV] Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.
04:16	Calculon	[on TV] That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain.
04:21	Fry	Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?
04:26	Hermes	We'll bill you for the couch.
04:35	Bender	Cheer up, meatbag. You've barely touched your amoeba.
04:39	Fry	It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
04:42	Bender	Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol. [He drinks a glass.] The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
04:52	Fry	What are the cigars for?
04:54	Bender	They make me look cool.
04:56	Fry	I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
05:00	Bender	Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk. [He points over his shoulder at a man.] That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?
05:09	Fry	I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
05:13	Bender	Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?
05:17	Fry	Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
05:21	Bender	Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
05:33	Bender	Here we are. Your new home.
05:34	Fry	Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.
05:38	Bender	Come on in, I'll give you the tour!
05:53	Bender	Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space.
06:04	Fry	It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
06:07	Bender	Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.
06:16	Fry	Wait, Bender. Bender?
06:21	Bender	[sleep-talking] Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.
06:27	Fry	Bender, wake up!
06:30	Bender	I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
06:35	Fry	Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?
06:38	Bender	Bath what?
06:39	Fry	Bathroom.
06:40	Bender	What room?
06:41	Fry	Bathroom!
06:42	Bender	What what?
06:43	Fry	Ah, never mind!
06:49	Bender	[sleep-talking] Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all the humans?
07:02	Leela	We sure are cheerful this morning.
07:04	Bender	Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
07:15	Leela	What happened to you?
07:16	Fry	Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle? [Leela twists his neck back properly.] Now you're OK.
07:25	Leela	Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
07:29	Fry	[sexily] Is that an invitation?
07:32	Leela	Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out.
07:36	Fry	Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.
07:40	Bender	Hey, there's my little space heater.
07:46	Fry	Well, I'm moving out!
07:48	Bender	What?
07:49	Fry	I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.
07:51	Bender	Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.
08:00	Leela	What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
08:03	Bender	I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place. [He presses some buttons in his chest cabinet.] And now they're gone.
08:13	Underwater house salesman	Sure, it ain't one of them la-de-da above-ground places. But if you like dank, hey, forget about it!
08:21	Leela	At least it's got a great view.
08:24	Bender	What the--?
08:31	Underwater House Salesman	Excuse me. I gotta go change a lightbulb.
08:38	Leela	Wow! Now this is fantastic!
08:41	Fry	Hmm. I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.
08:55	Fry	Well, I give up. What's the catch?
08:57	Suspiciously fantastic apartment salesman	Oh, no catch. Although we are technically in New Jersey.
09:01	Fry	Not one place even remotely liveable.
09:04	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? To shreds, you say. Very well then. [He hangs up.] Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mbutu.
09:21	Leela	Was his apartment rent-controlled?
09:29	Leela	Wow. This is beautiful.
09:32	Bender	What's with all the crap?
09:33	Leela	It's not crap.
09:34	Hattie	Dr. Mbutu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it ... universe!
09:40	Fry	Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about: A TV.
09:44	Hattie	It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it ... idiot!
09:49	Fry	Ooh!
09:50	Bender	Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't ... cosy. [Fry opens a closet and Bender walks inside.] Ah. I can barely move! [He closes the door.] (from inside) It's perfect!
10:52	Fry	Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.
10:57	Bender	Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first.
11:09	Hermes	Hey, mon!
11:12	Leela	Happy housewarming, Fry! [Fry stares blankly at Leela's gift.] It's a miniature fruit salad tree.
11:17	Fry	Ooh! [He takes off a miniature banana, peels it, eats it and tosses the skin on the floor. Amy slips over it and screams.] Hey, Amy!
11:25	Amy	Hey!
11:26	Prof. Farnsworth	This is for you, Fry [He hands Fry a small, gift-wrapped mummy.] Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style.
11:33	Bender	Wow! Heavy-drinking crowd! [He belches fire.] I'd better go out for more beer.
11:38	Fry	Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!
11:42	Bender	I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.
11:54	Fry	Hey!
12:01	Hermes	These are mighty tasty!
12:02	Zoidberg	Thank you. I made them myself.
12:07	Fry	Sh! The wedding's about to start!
12:09	Preacherbot	[on TV] If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their—
12:17	Fry	Is he objecting or backing up?
12:19	Amy	Looks like both.
12:21	Calculon	[on TV] I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret and that secret is--
12:27	Amy	Oh, this isn't right.
12:28	Hermes	Oh, come on!
12:29	Prof. Farnsworth	Fix it!
12:30	Bender	Hey, what happened to the TV?
12:32	Fry	It just went out.
12:33	Bender	This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
12:38	Hermes	Alright!
12:39	Fry	[shouting] Come back, Bender! It's working!
12:41	Calculon	[on TV] To reiterate, my terrible secret is--
12:47	Fry	It's out again.
12:48	Bender	What? That's the last straw!
12:51	Fry	It's back on!
12:56	Hattie	Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble with their TV reception.
13:05	Bender	Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
13:09	Hattie	Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference.
13:29	Tenant #1	What's going on?
13:30	Tenant #2	We want our TV back!
13:35	Hattie	There's your problem.
13:37	Amy	Oh, my God! Bender, it's your thingy!
13:39	Randy Munchnik	Then get rid of it!
13:41	Tenant #1	Get out!
13:42	Bender	You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
13:46	Leela	You had cable. This is satellite.
13:49	Prof. Farnsworth	Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
13:52	Huge-assed woman	They're on my cell phone too.
13:54	Bender	Madam, I believe you're mistaken!
13:57	Bender	[thinking; on phone] Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!
14:00	Bender	Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!
14:04	Randy Munchnik	The robot has to go!
14:05	Tenant #1	Yeah.
14:06	Tenant #3	Get him out of here!
14:08	Hattie	Well, you heard the mob!
14:09	Bender	Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?
14:15	Fry	It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.
14:19	Bender	Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
14:25	Fry	Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?
14:30	Bender	I don't understand.
14:32	Fry	Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?
14:36	Bender	But, then we wouldn't be roommates.
14:39	Fry	I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
14:41	Hattie	No he can't.
14:43	Fry	Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.
14:47	Bender	[downbeat] Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.
14:55	Randy Munchnik	Hey, the TV's back on!
14:58	Preacherbot	[on TV] We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; industrialist, private eye, friend.
15:04	Calculon	[on TV] Mind if I give the eulogy?
15:08	Monique	[on TV] Calculon! You're alive!
15:13	Randy Munchnik	Calculon's back!
15:16	Prof. Farnsworth	Right, so long.
15:18	Zoidberg	Goodbye.
15:19	Amy	[crying] Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
15:23	Hermes	I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.
15:24	Fry	Hey, thanks for coming.
15:28	Leela	Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?
15:32	Fry	Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.
15:35	Leela	Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
15:39	Fry	Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
15:43	Leela	Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.
15:46	Fry	Same thing.
15:51	Bender	It's so big and empty.
15:56	Bender	My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes. [He takes out a beer from his chest cabinet.] Oh, what's the point?
16:16	Leela	Bender? [He turns around and she gasps.] My God, you're a mess!
16:22	Bender	Leave me alone!
16:24	Leela	Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?
16:29	Bender	Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
16:32	Leela	Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.
16:37	Bender	I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
16:41	Leela	Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this.
16:46	Bender	Like how? Having my antenna removed?
16:49	Leela	Well, if that would work.
16:51	Bender	Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
17:03	Leela	Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
17:10	Bender	I promise nothing!
17:50	Fry	What up?
17:51	Leela	I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
17:54	Fry	Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
17:57	Leela	Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
18:03	Fry	Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
18:06	Leela	He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him.
18:11	Fry	Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.
18:16	Fry	Oh, stupid TV! [Enter Bender.] Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!
18:23	Bender	That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
18:27	Fry	Don't do it!
18:28	Bender	I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.
18:39	Leela	Bender! Stop!
18:40	Fry	Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
18:42	Bender	No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
18:45	Fry	Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?
18:48	Leela	Fry! Don't help him mutilate himself.
18:51	Fry	But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
18:55	Bender	I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
19:12	Fry	Hey, it works! The static's gone.
19:15	Human Friend	[on TV] I hate that this came between us, Calculon.
19:17	Calculon	[on TV] Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.
19:21	Human Friend	[on TV] You're my best friend. I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
19:25	Calculon	[on TV] Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
19:31	Leela	You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
19:33	Fry	She's right.
19:35	Bender	You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
19:40	Fry	Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
19:45	Leela	Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. [Fry and Bender stare blankly.] Fry's the one who should be-- [Fry and Bender keep staring.] Oh, never mind!
19:57	Fry	What's wrong?
19:58	Bender	Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
20:03	Fry	Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?
20:08	Bender	Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
20:13	Smitty	Bingo!
20:15	URL	You call that an antenna?
20:22	Bender	This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.
20:33	Fry	It's good to be home.
20:35	Bender	It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.
20:38	Fry	So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?
20:44	Bender	There's a window in the closet.
20:49	Fry	This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?
20:53	Bender	In a closet? Oh, humans!
