00:04	Prof. Farnsworth	As new employees, I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Super Bowl.
00:10	Fry	Wow!
00:11	Prof. Farnsworth	Not on the same channel, of course.
00:15	Announcer	[voice-over; on screen] Interplanetary deliveries - what a headache!
00:18	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	[on screen] Evans! Where's that package from Earth?
00:20	Man	[on screen] Uh... [Horrible Gelatinous Blob eats him. The man is suspended in the creature's translucent body.] [shouting] I'm not Evans!
00:25	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	[on screen] He should've used Planet Express!
00:29	Announcer	[voice-over; on screen] When those other companies aren't brave or foolhardy enough to go, trust Planet Express for reliable, on time delivery.
00:39	Evans	[on screen] Here's your package, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob.
00:42	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	[on screen] Good work, Evans! You've got a future around here.
00:48	Evans	[on screen] Thank you, sir!
00:50	Announcer	[voice-over; on screen] Planet Express: Our crew is replaceable. Your package isn't.
00:56	Fry	Are there really giant birds like that?
00:58	Prof. Farnsworth	No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs.
01:47	Fry	I'm never going to get used to the 31st century. [He points to his breakfast.] Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
01:54	Leela	Well, if you don't like that, try some Archduke Chocula.
01:58	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you.
02:07	Hermes	Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one of you is the captain?
02:12	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose.
02:17	Fry	Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
02:22	Prof. Farnsworth	Hmm, you!
02:26	Hermes	OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen.
02:33	Leela	[reading] Death by airlock failure.
02:34	Hermes	Mm.
02:35	Leela	[reading] Death by brain parasite.
02:36	Hermes	Yeah.
02:37	Leela	[reading] Death by sonic diarrhoea?
02:38	Hermes	[chuckling] Oh, you don't want that!
02:40	Leela	Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible.
02:46	Hermes	Sign the paper!
02:48	Prof. Farnsworth	Now, Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little ... unusual. [whispering] He wears sandals!
03:01	Fry	Hi--
03:02	Prof. Farnsworth	Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.
03:06	Zoidberg	Excellent, excellent!
03:11	Prof. Farnsworth	You'll be fine.
03:15	Zoidberg	Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain. [Fry opens his mouth.] No, no, no, no, no, not that mouth!
03:20	Fry	I only have one.
03:22	Zoidberg	Really?
03:24	Fry	Uh, is there a human doctor around?
03:26	Zoidberg	Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say... [He makes a weird noise. Fry clears his throat and tries to imitate him but fails.] What? My mother was a saint! Get out!
03:45	Prof. Farnsworth	Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy.
03:47	Bender	Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!
03:50	Prof. Farnsworth	Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?
03:54	Amy	OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
03:57	Leela	Ow!
03:58	Bender	A little.
03:59	Fry	Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?
04:03	Prof. Farnsworth	As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine. [whispering] I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me.
04:14	Amy	Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?
04:19	Fry	[chuffed] Last time I checked.
04:20	Leela	Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
04:23	Amy	Look, we're not as rich as everybody says.
04:26	Leela	Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
04:28	Amy	[ashamed] Kappa Kappa Wong.
04:30	Bender	Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. [His body reaches into Amy's back pocket, takes out her wallet and empties the money into his neck.] [singing] Look at my head. It's all painted! Look at my head! I got a big, old head, hey! Ho! [His body replaces the wallet and signals an all clear] [talking] Alright, show's over, I'm tired.
04:44	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, to be young again. And also a robot. Now, as I recall, you youngsters have a package to deliver.
04:51	Fry	Finally! Come on, Bender. Let's mosey!
04:57	Bender	Nice catch, idiot!
05:04	Fry	So where are we going anyway?
05:05	Leela	Nowhere special. The moon.
05:07	Fry	The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
05:15	Amy	Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?
05:18	Leela	Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.
05:25	Prof. Farnsworth	Nothing will go wrong. [He leans over to Leela.] [whispering] If something goes wrong, bring back the blood.
05:37	Fry	Can I do the countdown?
05:39	Leela	Huh? Oh, sure. Knock yourself out.
05:41	Fry	Ten ... [The ship takes off, clears the atmosphere and approaches the moon.] ... nine--
05:43	Leela	OK, we're here!
05:44	Fry	[awestruck] Eightsevensixfivefourthreetwooneblastoff!
05:55	Fry	Hurry up! I wanna see the moon!
05:57	Leela	Relax. It's open till 9.
05:59	Fry	That's one small step for Fry--
06:02	Man	And one giant line for admission!
06:06	Fry	Wow! [He turns to the man.] Um, can I have cuts?
06:09	Man	Hmm ... no!
06:16	Fry	You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
06:20	Amy	Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
06:23	Fry	Let's go, already!
06:24	Leela	Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
06:27	Fry	Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
06:29	Bender	Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
06:32	Leela	OK, if everyone's finished being stupid--
06:35	Fry	I had more but you go ahead.
06:37	Leela	We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
06:40	Fry	But I've never been to the moon before.
06:43	Leela	Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. [The other three high-five.] Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.
06:56	Amy	Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir-- Um, ma'am!
07:02	Amy	Clear?
07:03	Fry	Clear!
07:04	Amy	Ready to hoist?
07:05	Fry	Ready!
07:06	Amy	Ow!
07:15	Fry	My first space delivery.
07:17	Fry	Uh, greetings, Moon Man. We come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.
07:23	Sal	Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.
07:27	Fry	But you are lazy, right?
07:28	Sal	Oh, don't get me started.
07:43	Craterface	Hi, I'm Craterface! Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir.
07:50	Bender	Better mascots than you have tried.
07:56	Craterface	At least I still have my self respect!
08:10	Leela	Who buys this trash?
08:11	Bender	Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
08:15	Fry	Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
08:19	Bender	Get it off! Get it off! Get it-- Uh-oh! [He starts singing his own version of Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind".] [singing] How many roads must a man walk down, before you-- [He howls. Fry takes the magnet off and Bender gasps.] [talking] Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!
08:37	Fry	So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
08:40	Bender	Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
08:48	Whalerbots	[singing] We're whalers on the moon,We carry a harpoon,But there ain't no whales,So we tell our tall tale,And sing our whaling tune!
08:57	Whalerbot	Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!
08:59	Bender	Oh, jeez! I went to high school with that guy!
09:03	Announcer	Monsanto presents: The Goophy Gopher Revue!
09:07	Gopher #1	Why does a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock?
09:11	Gopher #2	Because it's a little meteor!
09:18	Fry	This is weak!
09:20	Gopher #1	Address all complaints to the Monsanto corporation.
09:25	Leela	What's wrong, Fry?
09:26	Fry	I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth. [He tosses his candy floss into a bin and runs to a window.] That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!
09:42	Leela	But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
09:45	Bender	Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
09:50	Leela	Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
09:59	Fry	I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
10:02	Bender	[shouting] Next year in Jerusalem!
10:07	Fry	Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
10:13	Narrator	[on loudspeaker] The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.
10:19	Ralph Kramden-bot	One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!
10:26	Leela	Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!
10:30	Fry	That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.
10:42	Amy	Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball! [Bender taps her on the shoulder.] Hm?
10:46	Bender	Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.
10:52	Amy	The keys to the ship! [She pats her pockets.] They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!
10:58	Bender	Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
11:01	Amy	Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
11:03	Sal	What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
11:18	Narrator	[on loudspeaker] No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon.
11:22	Fry	I do.
11:23	Narrator	[on loudspeaker] But our fun-gineers think it might have happened something like this:
11:28	Whalerbots	[singing] We're whalers on the moon,
11:30	Gophers	[singing] We carry a harpoon,
11:32	Whalerbots	and [singing] But there ain't no whales so we tell a tall tale...
11:36	Leela	[singing] And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--
11:37	Fry	That's not how it happened.
11:40	Leela	Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!
11:42	Fry	This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
11:45	Leela	Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.
11:51	Fry	Not for long!
11:56	Whalerbot	Ooh! Ah! I died doin' what I loved.
12:01	Leela	OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?
12:09	Fry	Agreed. [He drives over craters and flies through the air, cheering.] Yeah! Crank up the radio!
12:15	Whalerbots	[singing; on radio] We're whalers on the--
12:18	Fry	Yee-haw!
12:22	Leela	Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
12:25	Fry	No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
12:28	Leela	That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
12:31	Fry	Well I'm feelin' lucky! [The car suddenly falls into a huge crater and starts to sink at the bottom.] Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.
12:43	Fry	We're gonna die! It's every man for himself! [He jumps off the car and starts to sink.] Help me, Leela! [Leela grabs Fry and an oxygen canister and flies out of the crater.] You did it! We're safe!
13:00	Leela	No. Now we're gonna die.
13:03	Fry	It's every man for himself.
13:09	Bender	Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!
13:12	Amy	Shut up. You're distracting me.
13:14	Bender	Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know: Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor.
13:21	Amy	I know how to make love!
13:24	Bender	Here, let me do it. [He puts his hand up the chute and grabs the keys but then drops them.] Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged! [Moon Patrol officers walk up behind him.] That's her, officers! [He points at Amy.] Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!
13:44	Bender	Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!
13:57	Fry	[gasping] I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.
14:11	Leela	Thank God!
14:14	Hydroponic Farmer	Trespassers, eh?
14:15	Fry	No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.
14:18	Farmer	Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is mighty wicked.
14:23	Leela	Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
14:26	Farmer	Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up.
14:38	Fry	I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
14:40	Leela	Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.
14:43	Farmer	Yup. Drops down to -173!
14:46	Fry	Fahrenheit or Celsius?
14:47	Farmer	First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain't goin' nowhere till sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?
15:00	Fry	Robot daughters?
15:02	Farmer	This here is Lulabelle 7.
15:03	Lulabelle 7	Yoo-hoo!
15:05	Farmer	Daisy-Mae 128K.
15:07	Daisy-Mae 128K	Yoo-hoo!
15:09	Farmer	And the Crushinator.
15:12	Crushinator	[mechanical voice] Yoo-hoo.
15:14	Fry	Whoa!
15:15	Leela	I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.
15:22	Fry	And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.
15:31	Leela	Fry, face it: The moon is a dump. It's a boring, dried-up wasteland and the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?
15:41	Fry	I guess I can't.
15:46	Farmer	I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
15:49	Bender	He'll never find me in here.
15:52	Leela	Bender?
15:53	Fry	Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?
15:57	Bender	Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
16:12	Farmer	Oh, no you don't! C'mere, Crushinator.
16:15	Crushinator	[mechanical voice] Yes, Pa.
16:33	Fry	It's too low.
16:34	Leela	Hang on. Hang on. Jump! [The trio jump over the bridge and the buggy drives under it. They land back in the car. The Crushinator slams into it and cuts her way through. They come to a gorge.] Hold on to your helmet!
16:56	Farmer	God darn it, Crushinator, jump!
16:59	Crushinator	[mechanical voice] No, Pa. I love him.
17:07	Fry	Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!
17:10	Leela	Nightfall's coming. [The shadow falls over Fry and he starts to shiver.] Hurry, before we freeze.
17:15	Bender	What do you mean "we", mammal?
17:24	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.
17:35	Leela	We can't outrun it forever.
17:38	Fry	Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
17:48	Leela	Quick, get in.
17:51	Fry	It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint! [He stamps over it.] Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?
18:02	Leela	Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust. [The shadow creeps over Fry and his smile fades.] Now get in here before you freeze.
18:22	Bender	Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing.
18:36	Leela	Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
18:40	Fry	Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.
18:43	Leela	That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.
18:49	Fry	I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
19:01	Leela	A week would be a little much.
19:03	Fry	The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. [Leela's cold glance becomes a sympathetic frown.] But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.
19:25	Leela	Fry, look. [Fry and Leela gaze at a stunning Earthrise]. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.
19:42	Farmer	Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
19:56	Fry	It's Amy! We're saved!
19:58	Leela	Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
20:10	Bender	Not the magnet! No! No! No-- [The winch grabs him.] Uh-oh!
20:17	Bender	[singing] She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes--[talking] I'll kill you Amy![singing] She'll be comin' round the mountain,She'll be comin' round the mountain,She'll be comin'--
20:33	Farmer	Aw, dang it!
20:41	Bender	[singing] She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,She'll be riding six white horses when she comes--[talking] Hey, I'm pretty good![singing] She'll be riding six white horses...
20:50	Leela	[from lander] So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?
20:55	Fry	[from lander] Well ... close enough!
20:57	Bender	[singing; over credits] Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,Oh, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,When she comes!I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,I'll be blastin' all the humans,I'll be blastin' all the humans,I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,In the world![shouting] One more time!
