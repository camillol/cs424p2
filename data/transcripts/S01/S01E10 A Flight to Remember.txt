	Leela	That was the worst delivery ever.
	Fry	Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called "Cannibalon"!
	Bender	Me neither. [upbeat] Food was good, though.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, great news, everyone.
	Bender	Shove it! We quit!
	Prof. Farnsworth	In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
	Leela	Vacation?
	Bender	Alright!
	Fry	This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
	Bender	Aww, you!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built. [He pulls out a brochure.] The Titanic!
	Leela	Looks nice.
	Fry	Hey, uh, where's my suitcase? [His suitcase flies out from the tube and knocks him over.] Ow!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	As Mayor of New New York, it's my pleasure to introduce the honorary captain for the Titanic's maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula: Zapp Brannigan!
	Leela	Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!
	Zoidberg	You know Zapp Brannigan?
	Leela	Let's just say we've "crossed paths".
	Bender	Was that before or after you slept with him?
	Zapp	She's a beautiful ship, alright. Shapely ... seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains out. [The crowd applauds. Zapp holds up his hand and they stop.] And now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic.
	Zapp	Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness the subtle waltz known as seduction. [Kif sighs. Leela stops as Zapp blocks her way.] So, trapped on a ship with me. What say you and I knock some very sensual boots?
	Leela	It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ... [She repeatedly looks at Farnsworth, Zoidberg and Fry, makes a quick decision, then pulls Fry forward.] Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.
	Fry	Huh? [Leela eblows him.] Ooh! How do you do?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, here's my stateroom.
	Bender	Come on, where is it?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife, LaBarbara, have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.
	Fry	Man, first class seems nice!
	Prof. Farnsworth	It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
	Amy	Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
	Leela	This is it.
	Fry	Well at least we get a window!
	Bender	Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!
	Amy	I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
	Fry	I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc´ ... all alone ... on a romantic cruise.
	Leela	Take it off or I'll break it off.
	Fry	OK!
	Zapp	Captain's inspection!
	Bender	Hmm. [Through his eyes we see his cheat unit predicting the dice. He chuckles.] I'm bettin' it all! [He empties the chips from his chest cabinet.] Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!
	Croupier	Snake eyes.
	Bender	No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
	Croupier	Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs. Next shooter.
	Bender	Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.
	iZac	You got it!
	Bender	Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
	Countess	Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
	Bender	I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word "labour".
	Countess	Oh, Mr. Bender!
	Bender	Please, call me Bender.
	Countess	[embarrassed] Oh, goodness. I don't--
	Zapp	Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.
	Kif	I'll get the powder, sir.
	Zapp	No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course.
	Kif	Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency.
	Zapp	That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.
	Kif	But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.
	Zapp	Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jack-knifing from one to the next at breakneck speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or something. [Kif sighs.] It's time to shove a jalapeño up this ships tailpipe. [He grabs the wheel.] Divert power from the shields, full speed ahead!
	Amy	Oh, yeah!
	Mrs. Wong	Amy! Hello!
	Amy	Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
	Mr. Wong	We were planning on enjoying a relaxing vacation. But since you're here, we'll have to do some meddling.
	Mrs. Wong	We met the nicest boy in the cabin next to ours.
	Mr. Wong	He's not very ugly.
	Mrs. Wong	You should marry him! Or at least use him to conceive a grandchild for us.
	Mr. Wong	There he is at the buffet!
	Amy	Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend.
	Mrs. Wong	Really? Where is he?
	Mr. Wong	And why isn't he here right now fathering our grandchild?
	Amy	Uh...
	Leela	Well, our accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here.
	Fry	Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!
	Leela	Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancé thing was a terrible, terrible--
	Fry	Hmm? Mmm!
	Zapp	Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out with this pipsqueak here ... [He puts his hand on her shoulder.] ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score you on the rebound.
	Leela	Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
	Fry	Well, you got anything else for him?
	Leela	Alright, can we try not to complicate this?
	Amy	Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend.
	Fry	Hmm? Mmm!
	Fry	See you later, wuvvums!
	Leela	It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
	Fry	I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?
	Leela	What? No. No! Of course not!
	Fry	Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.
	Countess	Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
	Bender	I was just about to suggest the same thing. [The Countess giggles then disappears into the bathroom. The sound of a power tool comes from the room. Bender rubs his hands with glee. He rummages through her drawers and sees a bracelet on the table. He picks it up and chuckles.] Pay dirt!
	Countess	Lovely, isn't it?
	Bender	Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
	Countess	Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!
	Bender	I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?
	iZac	It's obvious, Mr. B. You're in love.
	Bender	Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.
	iZac	Hey, you gonna pay for those?
	Bender	Hell, no!
	iZac	Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
	Bender	Fellas, please. I'm in love!
	iZac	Rough him up!
	Countess	What are you doing?
	iZac	This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am.
	Countess	I see. Here you are, sir. [She hands iZac some money.] Keep the change.
	iZac	You got it!
	Zoidberg	Aha!
	Fry	Go, Professor!
	Amy	Lean back more!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ow!
	LaBarbara	Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo all of these people!
	Hermes	Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened.
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] Now limbo-ing for the Earth team, Hermes Conrad.
	Boy	[shouting] You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!
	Hermes	No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!
	Boy	I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--
	Hermes	[screaming] Nooo!
	LaBarbara	There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't make you any less of a man.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Though it did get me some action!
	Hattie	I like a man who's flexible!
	Zapp	Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden of naming a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone.
	Kif	Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?
	Zapp	And the winner is, Leela!
	Leela	But I didn't even limbo.
	Zapp	No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening.
	Bender	Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic.
	Countess	Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator.
	Bender	You do? Really?
	Zapp	I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older.
	Fry	Thank you, sir.
	Zapp	As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.
	Fry	Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.
	Amy	Hey, Fry.
	Leela	Amy!
	Amy	Leela!
	Zapp	Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete.
	Leela	[whispering] What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
	Fry	[whispering] Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
	Zapp	I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!
	Mrs. Wong	Hear, hear! Now let's have a kiss!
	Zapp	Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.
	Fry	Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--
	Mr. Wong	What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter already!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?
	Fry	Uh...
	Kif	Captain, may I have a word with you?
	Zapp	No.
	Kif	It's an emergency, sir.
	Zapp	Come back when it's a catastrophe. [There is a crash and the ship shakes. Zapp reluctantly stands up.] Oh, very well.
	Amy	Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss.
	Fry	Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.
	Kif	Sir, remember your course correction?
	Zapp	No.
	Kif	Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
	Zapp	Kif, old friend, I don't know which disgusts me more: Your cowardice or your stupidity! We'll simply set a new course for that empty region over there. Near that black-ish hole-ish thing.
	Fry	Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?
	Leela	I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
	Fry	Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.
	Leela	Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.
	Fry	I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.
	Leela	Nice nebula.
	Fry	Yeah.
	Leela	Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
	Fry	And me.
	Leela	What was that? [She looks over the railings and sees.] Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.
	Fry	Talk about a mood killer!
	Zapp	Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but for the captain to go down with his ship.
	Kif	Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir.
	Zapp	No, it's noble of you, Kif! [He tears his captain's patch off.] As of now ... [He puts the patch on Kif.] ... you're in command. Congratulations, captain!
	Leela	OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[shouting] I'm too young to die!
	Leela	Come on, before it's too late!
	Bender	You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.
	Fry	You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?
	Bender	[whispering] Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
	Fry	I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
	Bender	I love you, buddy!
	Bender	[shouting] Countess? Countess?
	Countess	[shouting] Bender!
	Countess	[shouting] I fell through the deck.
	Bender	[shouting] Are you hurt, my sweet?
	Countess	[shouting] No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
	Bender	Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
	Countess	Bender, you risked your life to save me.
	Bender	And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it. [They kiss.] When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
	Leela	Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
	Hermes	[gasping] Faster!
	Leela	It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
	Fry	Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
	Hermes	No one, except a legendary limbo champion.
	LaBarbara	Oh, Hermes!
	Hermes	Ooh! It's been a while. [He leans back and tries to go under the door. His knees hit it.] This one is for that little kid who's limbo-ing up in heaven right now.
	LaBarbara	That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!
	Hermes	I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.
	LaBarbara	Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!
	Hermes	Yes, dear.
	LaBarbara	That's my man!
	Amy	Yay, Hermes!
	Hermes	Uh, can somebody help me up?
	Countess	Well, now what are we going to do?
	Bender	Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
	Countess	By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Thank God there are plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.
	Leela	We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
	Mrs. Wong	Amy!
	Amy	Mom? Dad? You're alive!
	Mr. Wong	Yeah, but so what? The important thing is we found you a new man.
	Mrs. Wong	A captain.
	Amy	Uh, Mom, I don't-- [Enter Kif.] Hi!
	Kif	[sexfully] Hello!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I don't feel well!
	Fry	Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost-- [The nebula is sucked into the black hole.] Never mind!
	Hermes	Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
	Leela	I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
	Fry	Goodbye, Bender.
	Bender	[shouting] Wait for us!
	Leela	Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
	Amy	Well, it's not me!
	Fry	Look!
	Countess	I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!
	Bender	I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!
	Countess	No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware.
	Bender	Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
	Countess	[shouting] Farewell!
	Bender	[shouting] No!
	Bender	She's gone.
	Leela	But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.
	Fry	Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, yes, absolutely! [He turns to Zoidberg.] Not a chance!
	Bender	At least I'll always have her bracelet! [He hands it to Hermes.] What do you think it's worth?
	Hermes	It's fake, mon!
