	Linda	[on TV] Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool.
	Bender	Ooh! This is it! Turn me up!
	Linda	[on TV] Earlier today, a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers.
	Bender	More like three lockers and a sink!
	Leela	Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
	Bender	Of course not.
	Hermes	Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight Speedos!
	Amy	They don't leave much to the imagination.
	Hermes	Actually, on a robot, they sorta do.
	Morbo	[on TV] One puny human got a look at the robber...
	Bender	Here we go. Here we go!
	Morbo	[on TV] Describing him as a short, nasty, muscular...
	Bender	Yeah, make me famous, big head!
	Morbo	[on TV] Caucasian human male.
	Bender	What?
	Fry	Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
	Bender	This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever if nobody knows you did it?
	Fry	Well, there's the material rewards.
	Bender	You mean this junk? [He opens his chest cabinet and water floods out along with a beach ball, a float, a bikini top and a small child.]
	Boy	Whee!
	Bender	[crying] All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name. [hoarse] It's Bender.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, fuff! Why bother remembering anything? You're just going to forget it five seconds later.
	Bender	[crying] It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you, especially Leela. If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice.
	Scruffy	Boy, I've never seen him so down, or ever before.
	Bender	How does a nobody like me get famous? [He sees a mailbox and gasps.] I know! [He puts his foot in it.] Hey, look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft-news journalist!
	Woman	You're not stuck.
	Bender	[sadly] Shut up.
	Bender	Hey, everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!
	Roller-Skater	Yo, hotwheels. This circle's about free expression, not fascist moves!
	Bender	A blank wall! Fame is mine!
	Bender	There. Now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.
	Sal	Alrights, ladies, let's flush these artists lofts straights to hell!
	Bender	[screaming] No!
	Bender	I'm the first one to work. A new low.
	All	Surprise!
	Fry	Happy funeral, Bender!
	Bender	A surprise funeral? For me?
	Fry	We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
	Zoidberg	[opening the coffin] Now if the deceased would kindly take his place of honour.
	Bender	Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!
	Fry	Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life when he was crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk.
	Bender	Aw! You knew my favourite cause of death.
	Fry	Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
	Professor Farnsworth	Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a point-04% nickel impurity.
	Bender	[crying] It's what made me me.
	Hermes	If you ever needed a small package brought into the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity.
	Bender	Eh, the Professor's was better.
	Leela	Bender, shush. You're supposed to be dead.
	Bender	Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
	Zoidberg	[singing] Oh, Danny-boy,The pipes, the pipes are calling--
	Bender	Who-y-boy?
	Zoidberg	[singing] From glen to glen and down--
	Bender	Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead.
	Zoidberg	I'm expressing my sorrow.
	Bender	Get lost! I'd say "Don't quit your day job" but you're awful at that too.
	Leela	We're trying our best.
	Bender	Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up, people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked, now show me some love!
	Amy	Bender was a truly special--
	Bender	[shouting] Louder and sadder.
	Amy	[shouting] Bender was a truly special--
	Bender	[shouting] Next!
	Preacherbot	Dear Lord--
	Bender	[shouting] Oh, next!
	Zoidberg	[singing] Oh, Danny-boy--
	Bender	Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.
	Fry	Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender was my friend.
	Bender	What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! [He pushes his legs through the bottom of the coffin and stands up.] I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck.
	Amy	I know whose funeral we'll be attending next!
	Professor Farnsworth	[bashful] Oh, stop!
	Professor Farnsworth	News, everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enormous sandstone block.
	Fry	I thought something looked different in here.
	Fry	Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here.
	Osiran	Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million identical stones used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.
	Leela	Impressive. Who's building it?
	Osiran	You.
	Leela	Say again?
	Osiran	You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.
	Fry	Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.
	Fry	You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
	Leela	That's the only thing about being a slave!
	Osiran	Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip, heir to the Tenth Dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods.
	Fry	Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
	Osiran	That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago.
	Fry	I knew it! Insane theories, one; regular theories, a billion.
	Osiran	We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid-building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
	Fry	Also Wolfman!
	Bender	Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.
	Leela	Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
	Bender	Hey, you spend your whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him. [He looks across at a slave being whipped as he carves a stone toe.] I think I'm gonna like it here!
	Man #1	Yeah, I, uh, noticed your sign and I thought I'd come over here and look into getting involved in your program.
	Man #2	What we do is make you starve to death.
	Osiran	One, two, three, pull! [He whips them and they pull.] One, two, three, pull!
	Australian Man	Oh! Bloody chunder!
	Bender	Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?
	Osiran	Good idea, slave. [He whips Bender and counts quicker.] One-half, pull! [He whips them.] One-half, pull!
	Bender	Now we're slavin'!
	Bender	Come on, guys. Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this. [He pushes a block up the side of the tomb and the Osiran runs after him, whipping as he goes. He stops to catch his breath.] You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this.
	Leela	Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!
	Fry	Yeah. Remember who your real friends are.
	Bender	I'll tell you who I remember. [He points at some tombs.] Enupsis ... Pleeltut ... Whatshisname. He was the greatest of all.
	Osiran	Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches.
	Bender	Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place. Come on!
	Hermenthotip	Excellent work! I am very proud of all you slaves.
	Bender	Viva Hermenthotip!
	Hermenthotip	And now, I have a grand announcement. In honour of your achievement, you're all hereby--
	Bender	[screaming] No!
	Hermenthotip	[hoarse] Tell the slaves they can all go--
	Bender	Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
	Hermenthotip	[hoarse] No. I mean they are all free--
	Bender	Free-loading off you? I agree.
	Hermenthotip	[hoarse] No, I--
	Osiran	Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.
	Bender	[crying] He's whippin' angels now.
	High Priest	We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good looking! [He grins but no one laughs.] Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral.
	Bender	[crying] I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip!
	High Priest	To equip Pharaoh for his journey, we bury him with his favourite possessions. Such as his heart and liver. [The slaves lower some canopic jars into the hole.] And the many goods he left in his royal garage. [A pickup truck back up to the hole and tips Hermenthotip's stuff into it.] Also, this bag of cats our culture considers holy.
	Singer	[singing] Pharaoh my God-king,You are cold and deceased,I used to have him sing...
	Singer	P-P-P-Pharaoh and his pets...
	Singer	But the years went by,And Pharaoh died,Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife--
	Osiran	Hermenthotip is gone. The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.
	Bender	Wow!
	Osiran	At dawn tomorrow, the high priest will consult the Wall of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip's successor. [He points across the river at the illuminated wall. Bender hoots.] That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.
	Fry	Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
	Slave #1	Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one, except the rhythm!
	Leela	Yeah! Play those bongos!
	Fry	I'm gonna spin till I fall down!
	Bender	We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you late-breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
	High Priest	Great Wall of Prophecy, reveal to us God's will that we may blindly obey.
	Priests	[chanting] Free us from thought and responsibility.
	High Priest	We shall read things off you.
	Priests	[chanting] Then do them.
	High Priest	Your words guide us.
	Priests	[chanting] We're dumb.
	Fry	You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
	High Priest	The prophecy is strange and crudely drawn at best. It indicates that, we are "here" and our next Pharaoh is over there, near some ... tents.
	Bender	[shouting; from reeds] Those are waves, jackass. It's supposed to be a river!
	Fry	Hey. I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!
	Leela	Oh, Lord!
	High Priest	We hear your voice, oh, great Pharaoh. Reveal yourself to us.
	Bender	Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
	High Priest	It is he. Just as the Wall of Prophecy prophesied. [He points at Bender's imprinted face on the wall.] Long live Pharaoh Bender!
	Slaves	[chanting] Long live Pharaoh Bender!
	Leela	This society is a bunch of idiots.
	High Priest	People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to Lord of All Creation! Our new Pharaoh, Bender!
	Bender	Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past. [The crowd cheers.] Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
	Leela	What did he say?
	Bender	Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height ... [The priests gasp.] ... that I might be remember-ed for all eternity. And be quick about it!
	Bender	Lowly slave, why are you not working?
	Slave #2	I am.
	Bender	I meant yourself to death.
	Slave #3	Mighty Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe.
	Bender	Well then what do you think you should stop doing? [He taps Fry and Leela with his foot.] Crawl, pigs!
	Leela	Ow!
	Bender	The Pharaoh has spoken.
	Bender	Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
	Osiran	The great monument is finished, oh Pharaoh. And now, the unveiling.
	Statue	Remember me. [A jet of fire comes from its eyes.] Remember me. [Another jet.] Remember me.
	Osiran	Does it please you, my lord?
	Bender	Hmm ... it's a good start. Uh, yeah, it's definitely big alright. I just wonder if it's too big, y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?
	High Priest	But, sire, we made it to your exact specifications.
	Bender	Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and try again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
	High Priest	Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh suddenly died.
	Leela	Good riddance.
	Bender	[shouting; from tomb] What about my servants?
	Priest	Oh, yeah.
	Fry	Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't ... we're in trouble!
	Leela	You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
	Bender	I wanted to watch you remember me.
	Leela	Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
	Bender	Afterlife? Pft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now.
	Leela	Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
	Bender	Sorry, but we're totally sealed in. [He knocks the wall.] Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes. [Snakes pour in from the eyes on a picture of Bender à la the snakes in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Fry screams.] Here, have a pomegranate schnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender.
	Fry	What proof is this? Some huge number?
	Leela	It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble! [She jumps onto a wooden statue of Bender.] Let's get a little kindling going!
	Bender	No! You can't blow up my monument. I won't be remembered.
	Leela	Oh, right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot "Bender"?
	Fry	Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell. [Bender gasps.] Did you hear something, Leela?
	Leela	No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
	Bender	Stop it, stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line.
	Fry	Hey, Leela, you know who I remember?
	Bender	Oh, please, let it be me.
	Fry	That guy who used to bend things. You know?
	Bender	Me, please!
	Fry	Hermes.
	Bender	Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue.
	Leela	Oh, Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!
	Leela	Let's blow this tomb!
	Slave #1	Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among the living.
	Bender	[running past] How we doing?
	Statue	Remember me.
	Bender	[crying] I will. I will.
	Bender	Please, just leave me alone.
	Leela	Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that.
	Bender	[crying] I don't?
	Leela	No. You have your legacy as a brutal, tyrannical dictator, and that will outlive any monument.
	Bender	You really think they'll remember me?
	Fry	Absolutely.
	Bender	Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
	Bender	[from ship] Set course for Earth!
	Leela	[from ship] That's not Earth.
	Bender	[from ship] Oh.
