	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, Lord! Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks.
	Fry	Shh! What was that sound?
	Bender	It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this. [He shakes a branch and a nest falls off it and breaks when it hits the ground. The two birds in it fly away, twittering.] Aww, they're so cute when they're scared.
	Fry	I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week, a blind hiker felt him.
	Professor Farnsworth	Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot, you blathering ninny-hammer.
	Fry	Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with.
	Zoidberg	Why?
	Fry	'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.
	Zoidberg	[sadly] I can so relate to that.
	Leela	Ugh! Enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp, for God's sake. [quietly] Although you wouldn't know it from looking.
	Zoidberg	Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little "just friends" spooning.
	Bender	Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. [The trees collapse on top of him.] Real comfy!
	Ranger Park	Hey, I'm Ranger Park, the park ranger.
	Fry	I get it!
	Ranger Park	Now since this area's a national Bigfoot preserve, we'll start with a short film about Bigfoot while I make a few phone calls.
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] Bigfoot ... [A hand stamps some words over the caption.] ... Endangered Mystery! [The movie shows a map of North America.] In the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest ... [The scene changes to the Patterson-Gimlin film.] ... dwells the strange and beautiful creature known as Bigfoot, perhaps.
	Fry	That proves it!
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] Sadly, logging and human settlement today threaten what might possibly be his habitat. Although if it's not, they don't. Bigfoot populations require vast amounts of land to remain elusive in. [The scene changes to some rocks.] They typically dwell just behind rocks but are also sometimes playful, bounding into thick fogs and out-of-focus areas.
	Ranger Park	It should say "Top Quality Exercycle For Sale" and could you put "top quality" in bold? You can't? OK, whatever.
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] Remember, it's up to us. Bigfoot is a crucial part of the ecosystem, if he exists. So let's all help keep Bigfoot possibly alive for future generations to enjoy unless he doesn't exist. The end.
	Ranger Park	I-I gotta call you back. [He hangs up.] Alright, questions?
	Sal	Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?
	Ranger Park	Technically, no. But I do see him each night in my dreams and each day in the silent faces of hairy children.
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!
	Ranger Park	[holding up a bag] I have the droppings of someone who saw Bigfoot.
	Professor Farnsworth	Shut up!
	Bender	Oh, my God! Look! It's Bigfoot!
	Ranger Park	Where?
	Bender	Eh, he's gone. He said you should keep wasting your life though.
	Petunia	Oh! I saw Bigfoot crushing cars at the county fair.
	Ranger Park	What you saw was Bigfoot the monster truck. But thanks for a great question.
	Fry	Sir, if I may, why don't you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one?
	Ranger Park	Ah, that would be very expensive, and most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke.
	Bender	Hey, look! Bigfoot! He's back!
	Ranger Park	Where?
	Bender	Up your face! [He laughs.] Everybody do the Bender!
	Amy	The sky out here is amazing. Look at all those satellites.
	Professor Farnsworth	Goodnight, employees.
	Hermes	Goodnight.
	Zoidberg	Goodnight, Hubert.
	Fry	You doin' alright out there, buddy?
	Bender	Better than these gnats! [He zaps a few more and laughs.] That guy won't be goin' home to his kids.
	Bender	Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh, God, I wish I was safe inside a tent. [He hides behind a rock.] [deep voice] Fry! Fry wake up! It's me, Bigface!
	Bender	[from outside] Come out and groom my mangy fur!
	Fry	[turning on his lamp] Huh? Bigfoot? You taught yourself English?
	Fry	Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
	Fry	Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others, Bigfoot; I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health while you go... [He "coos".] But in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things. [He walks into a clearing and looks around. Birds fly out from trees and the ground begins to shake. A strong wind blows leaves and things past Fry and a darkened flying saucer appears from over the trees. It lights up and beam of light engulfs Fry. He looks up and unshields his eyes.] Oh. Just a flying saucer. [shouting] Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there. [A tube extends from the spacecraft and zigzags around Ã  la the Windows 3D Pipes screensaver.] Wow! Nice tube. [It sucks him up.] Hey! Hey, what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say "Probe 1"?
	Leela	There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of this bold Canadian beer.
	Hermes	Well, see you in an hour. I gotta go do some business behind that tree.
	Amy	Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?
	Bender	[mocking] "Bender"!
	Leela	Bender raises a good point: Where is Fry?
	Fry	Amy, you won't believe what happened ... [She looks up.] ... it was so scary that you wouldn't-- [She screams and runs.] I know, but listen, it gets even scarier.
	Professor Farnsworth	Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
	Fry	That's what I'm trying to tell you. See-- [The staff gather around.] Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?
	Hermes	Uh ... no.
	Leela	Someone should tell him.
	Fry	Tell me what?
	Leela	Nothing.
	Zoidberg	Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently. [He shakes him.] [shouting] Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!
	Fry	What?
	Bender	Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!
	Fry	[poking his face] My God! They must have taken it last night.
	Professor Farnsworth	Which last night?
	Fry	In the woods. I was walking ... for Bigfoot, looking ... and then aliens beamed me up.
	Amy	Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads? [Fry taps where his nose would be.] I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?
	Zoidberg	Cheer up, friend. When we get home a high-quality prosthesis will have you looking good as new.
	Fry	I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
	Hermes	Man, you are such a jokester!
	Fry	I'll never have another moment of happiness.
	Leela	I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour, but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.
	Fry	[taking off the glasses] Eh, it wouldn't be the same. I want my nose. I don't want to have to teach a new one how to shoot milk when I laugh.
	Professor Farnsworth	Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord, you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
	Bender	[gasping] Guys! Guys! There's something on television.
	Linda	[on TV] Alien abductions: Until now, a harmless nuisance. But recently they've taken on a sinister dimension as unsuspecting victims are returned ... without noses.
	Fry	Like me!
	Morbo	[on TV] The culprits: Shameless poachers, hunting humans without a permit.
	Linda	[on TV] The valuable nose, or "human horn", fetches a high price on alien worlds as an aphrodisiac.
	Fry	My nose is an aphrodisiac? [He retches.] I'm gonna drop a barf!
	Morbo	[on TV] Demand for human horn is great, due, in part, to titillating scenes from depraved alien TV programmes too filthy for Earth broadcast. Let's watch.
	Neptunian Woman	[on TV] Human horn? But ... it is forbidden!
	Neptunian Man	[on TV] So is our love.
	Fry	Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?
	Leela	Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
	Zoidberg	No, I'm good.
	Alien	Let's see, I'll take a pancreas, two sphincters and a large Coke.
	Vendor	One number three combo!
	Fry	It's no use. We've been to every scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn.
	Leela	Wait. What's that?
	Salesman	Welcome, friends. How may I pervert you?
	Fry	Uh, I'm looking for human horn.
	Salesman	[whispering] Shh! You're not cops, right?
	Leela	Of course not. In fact, he's a crook.
	Bender	Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
	Salesman	Right this way.
	Salesman	Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks.
	Fry	Nope. Uh-uh. Ew! [He pulls out a photo of him and Slurms MacKenzie and points at his nose on the photo.] Now look. This is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?
	Salesman	I'm sorry, sir, but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer records are strictly confidential. [Leela punches him.] Right this way.
	Salesman	I video-tape everyone who comes in here so I can blackmail them later. [The crew gag.] Hey, I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Here's the weirdo who bought your horn.
	Leela	That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
	Lrrr	[on TV] You got any, uh, you know, uh [muttering] human horn?
	Salesman	[on TV] Speak up! You're muttering!
	Lrrr	[on TV] I said, uh [whispering] human horn?
	Salesman	[whispering; on TV] You're not a cop, right?
	Lrrr	[on TV] Oh, no, no. I'm just some guy ... ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!
	Lrrr	So let me get this straight: If I buy eight Caramello bars, you all get to go to some camp.
	Bender	Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
	Fry	Oh, great space king, I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
	Lrrr	Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would a virile male like Lrrr need human horn? I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put in salad dressing?
	Nd-Nd	Like you've ever seen a salad.
	Lrrr	My weight is appropriate and attractive!
	Leela	Whoa! You guys have issues.
	Lrrr	She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here, so make friends with the door.
	Fry	[sadly] Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
	Nd-Nd	Oh, let's just give it to him. [She picks up a box.] Here.
	Fry	My nose! Light of my face!
	Lrrr	Uh, what is that? How do you have that, Nd-Nd? [He pulls his cape string like a collar.] I've never seen it before. My friend left it here.
	Leela	Hold still, Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.
	Fry	Hey! You burned my cheek!
	Leela	Yeah, sorry, I wasn't really concentrating.
	Fry	No, I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it! [He sniffs.] And those lilacs on the table.
	Lrrr	At least someone noticed.
	Nd-Nd	For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your first wife was the one who liked lilacs.
	Lrrr	She also liked to shut up!
	Fry	Well, great seeing you. I guess we'll be on our--
	Bender	Yo, Highness. Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his, you know, wing-dang-doodle?
	Lrrr	But, uh, I thought the horn was the human wing-dang-doodle.
	Bender	No, sir, chief! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses, I'll tell you that much. Well, see you!
	Lrrr	Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn.
	Fry	Hey, what've you heard?
	Lrrr	[shouting] Guards! Seize him! [They do. Fry screams.] Prepare to harvest the lower horn!
	Fry	OK, you can have my nose.
	Lrrr	Guards!
	Guard #1	Yeah?
	Lrrr	Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me.
	Nd-Nd	In other words, slop a lot of ketchup and salt on it.
	Lrrr	Then bring it to our royal bedchamber and put it in the sock drawer with all the other things that have failed to arouse my passion for this woman.
	Guard #2	Remove pants!
	Fry	Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--
	Bender	[shouting] I'll say!
	Fry	But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good.
	Bender	[shouting] That's what she said!
	Leela	Let's face it, you two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.
	Fry	However huge it might be.
	Nd-Nd	So what do you suggest, painfully-single human?
	Leela	Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?
	Nd-Nd	Oh, I don't know. Lrrr used to be so tender.
	Lrrr	I only wrote that poem to test my printer.
	Nd-Nd	We'd go walking in the woods and Lrrr would find injured little tinkle-bunnies and nurse them back to health.
	Lrrr	Yes, but I'm the one who injured them!
	Nd-Nd	Oh, shush. You stepped on them by accident and then you cried all night. That's the kind of sensitive man you used to be.
	Lrrr	And you used to wear a size-3 cape. [shouting] But not anymore! Now bring me that lower horn while I'm still in the mood.
	Fry	Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
	Leela	Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars.
	Nd-Nd	Hmm. Sounds interesting. But he would never do it.
	Lrrr	Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going.
	Fry	Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
	Bender	I don't get it!
	Bender	Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
	Lrrr	No, thanks. Just water, please. Tap water!
	Nd-Nd	[sarcastic] Oh, big spender!
	Lrrr	[shouting] That's it! This date is over. Waiter!
	Fry	So, what can I get you this evening?
	Lrrr	Your lower horn!
	Fry	I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!
	Lrrr	Fine! But none of that whole-grain goat food. And bring plenty of melted butter.
	Nd-Nd	Why don't you just inject some fat straight into your ass and cut out the middle man?
	Lrrr	One of these days, Nd-Nd. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!
	Lrrr	[eating] Mmm! This jerked chicken is good. I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked.
	Bender	[shouting] It's used to it!
	Fry	So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing?
	Nd-Nd	Poorly.
	Lrrr	My wife is right, for once. There's very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel.
	Bender	Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin? [He takes a six pack out of his chest cabinet.] Hey, uh, mind if I stick these in here?
	Guard #1	Go for it.
	Leela	Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card; the most beautiful love song ever written.(singing badly) And I will always love you,[The Omicronians cover their ears.]Will always love you.
	Nd-Nd	The humans are attacking!
	Lrrr	Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
	Bender	Quick, Fry! Run for it!
	Fry	Come on, freedom cage! Roll me to safety! [It flips over and rolls through a campfire, setting it and Fry alight. It hits a tree and the door falls open. Fry steps out and pats out the fire.] Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!
	Bender	[shouting] Just like at the movie theatre!
	Lrrr	Give me that!
	Fry	Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it! The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
	Lrrr	Well, hello there, my furry friend.
	Nd-Nd	Look at his adorable little feet. [Bigfoot bangs his chest, growls and throws leaves into the air. Lrrr chuckles.] Yes, you are a cutie-pie.
	Ranger Park	Holy macaroni! [He takes some photos.] I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh, I've waited my entire life for this moment.
	Nd-Nd	What?
	Bender	What are you doing with that?
	Lrrr	You're going to kill this innocent giganto?
	Ranger Park	Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilize him so I can chop off his feet as proof he exists. Then dump him back in the wild. He'll do fine.
	Lrrr	You'll have to get through me first.
	Ranger Park	OK. Nighty night!
	Lrrr	Now leave this gentle Sasquatch, or Wood Ape, in peace so I can finally and at long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.
	Fry	Yeah!
	Lrrr	Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any better than that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough.
	Ranger Park	Score!
	Lrrr	This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing, and all living things, large and small--
	Bender	[shouting] In this case "small"!
	Lrrr	Have dignity and a spark of the divine.
	Nd-Nd	That's the gentle, sensitive, poet warlord I fell in love with.
	Lrrr	[shouting] Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500-metre radius!
	Leela	Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.
	Bender	As usual! [He hoots.] [shouting] Run away!
	Narrator	[voice-over; on TV] You're on a scenic route through a state recreation known as the human mind. You ask a passer-by for directions, only to find he has no face or something. Suddenly, up ahead, a door in the road. You swerve, narrowly avoiding The Scary Door.
	Scientist	[on TV] I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals to make the most evil creature of them all.
	Man	[on TV] It turns out it's Man.
