00:03	Leela	This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
00:08	Doug	You like the meal just wait until you try these after-dinner mints.
00:10	Leela	You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded. [They gaze across the table into each other's eyes. Without averting his gaze, Doug slips out a long pink tongue and licks up the mint.] Ew!
00:49	Fry	What was wrong with your date last night?
00:51	Leela	I don't know. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
00:57	Amy	You're too picky.
00:58	Fry	Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.
01:05	Leela	There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop--
01:08	Zoidberg	The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
01:15	Amy	You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later you realise he actually has a really good body.
01:22	Leela	Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is.
01:27	Bender	That sounds like a cry for help.
01:29	Amy	Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
01:33	Hermes	The Federal Sex Bureau.
01:34	Bender	A saucy puppet show.
01:36	Zoidberg	The rotting carcass of a whale.
01:38	Amy	Hmm, I'll pick!
01:46	Amy	Oh, wow! It's totally retro!
01:50	Fry	Why's everyone wearing those rings?
01:52	Amy	Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
01:55	Fry	I think they look cool.
01:57	Amy	Sh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
01:59	Man	Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?
02:01	Amy	Nope, he said they're stupid.
02:03	Man	Cool!
02:06	Amy	So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
02:08	Leela	I don't know. Maybe?
02:09	Bender	Forget it, he's gay.
02:11	Leela	What? How can you tell?
02:13	Bender	I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
02:16	Leela	There's no such thing.
02:18	Bender	No? [He pulls out a machine with a small antenna on it from his chest cabinet. The antenna swivels around.] OK, I got a lock on him. [The machine beeps.] Yep! He's gay!
02:27	Amy	Are you sure?
02:28	Bender	Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
02:33	21st-century girl	You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.
02:38	Fry	No way! We've got so much in common.
02:40	21st-century girl	We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?
02:44	Fry	Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.
02:47	Amy	This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit.
02:53	Bolt	Hello, beautiful!
02:55	Bender	[whispering] I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
02:58	Bolt	I wish! Those cats can really fly.
03:17	Amy	This is M5438, an entity of pure energy.
03:21	Leela	That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for.
03:25	M-5438	I understand. One day you will evolve beyond your physical body, and on that day I hope you will pick up the phone.
03:33	Amy	You're impossible.
03:36	Bender	Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
03:48	Fry	Pst. I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
03:52	Bender	Can do!
03:56	The Hip Joint janitor	My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like you— [Leela looks up.] Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, I thought you had two eyes.
04:04	Bender	So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time.
04:09	Leela	Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
04:12	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to.
04:18	Fry	A delivery?
04:19	Professor Farnsworth	No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
04:23	Computer Voice	This is Vergon 6.
04:25	Professor Farnsworth	This is Vergon 6.
04:27	Amy	[sarcastic] [[Coinage#B|Buh}}!
04:28	Professor Farnsworth	It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals.
04:33	Leela	Animals?
04:34	Professor Farnsworth	That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand pounds.
04:47	Leela	Wait! What about the animals?
04:49	Professor Farnsworth	Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.
04:57	Leela	Yes, but what about the animals?
05:00	Professor Farnsworth	The wha?
05:01	Leela	The animals.
05:02	Professor Farnsworth	I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.
05:09	Leela	So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
05:13	Bender	Why two? [Leela whispers something to him.] Oh!
05:21	Fry	I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
05:24	Bender	That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.
05:29	Fry	Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.
05:31	Leela	Do you mind?
05:33	Bender	Here you go. [He pulls out a fork.] You can use this as an eye-poker.
05:35	Leela	Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has ... as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...
05:44	Leela	[from ship] ...maybe a snappy dresser.
05:47	Zapp	These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?
05:49	Kif	I suppose, Captain. I'm not as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship?
05:56	Zapp	Destroy them! [As he raises his arm he flexes his muscle. He stops to feel it.] Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.
06:05	Zapp	Captain's journal: Star date, 3000.3.
06:08	Kif	Who are you talking to, sir?
06:10	Zapp	You! Aren't you getting this? [Kif sighs and scurries to a typing machine. Zapp dictates.] We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner ... ravioli, ham, sundae bar.
06:28	Leela	Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
06:30	Fry	Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
06:33	Leela	Uh-huh!
06:34	Fry	Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
06:36	Kif	Shall I fire on them now, sir?
06:38	Zapp	Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces. [Kif sighs.] What?
06:45	Leela	They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
06:51	Fry	Wow!
06:52	Bender	A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!
06:57	Leela	He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets.
07:01	Fry	[teasing] Leela's got a boyfriend!
07:03	Leela	No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
07:07	Bender	Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you. [He holds up the fork.]
07:14	Kif	Sir, they're headed straight for us.
07:16	Zapp	A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's Big Book of War. [He holds up the book with a picture of him on the front.] But the one thing their captain doesn't realise and never will is that--
07:28	Kif	Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard.
07:30	Zapp	Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod. [He gets up and heads for the door.] If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. box.
07:42	Leela	Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance.
07:48	Kif	Well, if there's anything--
07:50	Zapp	I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you?
07:55	Leela	Oh, not at all. I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!
08:00	Zapp	You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly -- a potent combination.
08:05	Leela	[flattered] You don't mean that!
08:07	Zapp	But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier.
08:13	Fry	I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system.
08:19	Zapp	The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.
08:23	Fry	Wow! I never would have thought of that!
08:25	Zapp	You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown. Kif, show them the medal I won. [Kif sighs and points to a medal on Zapp's uniform.]
08:39	Zapp	More, please. [Kif grates.] A little more ... more ... keep going.
08:45	Leela	Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.
08:47	Zapp	Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right, men?
08:53	Crewman	[shouting] You suck!
08:54	Leela	We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just--
08:58	Zapp	Vergon 6? This light dinner is over.
09:01	Leela	Wait! What's wrong?
09:02	Zapp	The Democratic Order of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds. It's a little rule known as "Brannigan's Law".
09:09	Leela	But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
09:14	Zapp	Yes, by a Democratic Order of Planets mining crew.
09:17	Leela	This doesn't make any sense.
09:19	Zapp	I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.
09:23	Leela	Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
09:26	Zapp	I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!
09:30	Fry	What just happened?
09:31	Bender	He's throwing us in prison.
09:33	Fry	Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
09:39	Leela	Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
09:45	Bender	You really are too picky.
09:46	Zapp	Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do.
09:53	Kif	Oh, jeez!
09:56	Zapp	I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?
10:00	Kif	I fail to see any problem, sir. You already imprisoned her under directive B-10.8-1.
10:06	Zapp	You mean Brannigan's Law?
10:08	Kif	Right, that law.
10:10	Zapp	Which one?
10:12	Kif	Brannigan's Law.
10:13	Zapp	Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again. As my protégé you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her. [Kif sighs.] This time we are sure she's a woman, right?
10:27	Kif	Yes.
10:28	Zapp	Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts.
10:34	Kif	"The boy", sir?
10:35	Zapp	You. You lay out my formal shorts.
10:39	Kif	The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.
10:42	Leela	Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.
10:46	Kif	And he wants you to wear this.
10:51	Zapp	[sexilly; from inside] Come and get it!
10:55	Zapp	Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, "the Lovenasium". Sham-pag-in?
11:02	Leela	I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
11:05	Zapp	Well I have studied abroad. Or two!
11:11	Leela	Captain--
11:12	Zapp	Uh-huh?
11:13	Leela	If we could speak seriously for a moment--
11:15	Zapp	Uh-huh?
11:16	Leela	I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
11:18	Zapp	Mm-hm. [He moves the bed closer to Leela. Leela pulls the plug out of the socket and the bed falls to the floor.] I like your style. I find it very... (whispering) erotic.
11:31	Leela	What?
11:32	Zapp	[shouting] Erotic!
11:39	Fry	We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.
11:43	Bender	Hey, yeah!
11:49	Fry	No good! It's full of steam!
11:52	Zapp	You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour bedspread.
11:58	Leela	I'm not really in the mood.
12:00	Zapp	Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go.
12:05	Leela	Can I please just go back to prison?
12:07	Zapp	You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?
12:11	Leela	Much rather! [Zapp starts to cry.] What are you doing?
12:18	Zapp	[crying] Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of the sham-pag-in?
12:26	Leela	No. And it's pronounced "sham-pane".
12:29	Zapp	[crying] Oh, God, no!
12:32	Leela	It's not a big deal.
12:34	Zapp	[crying] I get so lonely. I just thought you, a fellow captain, would understand.
12:39	Leela	Oh, forget it.
12:40	Zapp	[crying] Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're completely alone.
12:45	Leela	It comes with the job.
12:48	Zapp	[crying] I'm just so lonely!
12:52	Leela	Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad.
12:57	Fry	You wanna try escaping again?
12:59	Bender	Nah, I'm comfy.
13:01	Fry	Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan.
13:17	Zapp	Good morning, lover.
13:19	Leela	Uh, listen, Zapp.
13:21	Zapp	Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
13:25	Leela	Zapp, last night was a mistake.
13:27	Zapp	A sexy mistake.
13:29	Leela	No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity.
13:35	Zapp	A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling back to the Zapper.
13:42	Leela	The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away ... from!
13:46	Zapp	Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused.
13:49	Leela	Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.
13:54	Zapp	Go ahead. I won't stop you.
13:55	Leela	Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
13:57	Zapp	We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy ... bam!
14:09	Leela	Eurgh!
14:13	Zapp	[shouting] Kif!
14:15	Kif	Yes-- [He groans and looks away. Zapp is standing up holding the bed sheet over his crotch.] Yes, Captain?
14:18	Zapp	I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
14:24	Kif	The fatso says you're free to go.
14:26	Fry	Really? Why?
14:28	Kif	[quietly] "Why" indeed.
14:30	Fry	What does that mean?
14:31	Leela	[defensively] Nothing.
14:32	Bender	So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
14:35	Leela	[defensively] We just talked, OK?!
14:46	Leela	Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
15:24	Leela	Hello, there. [The animal sniffs around Leela's feet.] Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist.
15:34	Bender	So, you're saying we can cook him?
15:36	Fry	Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.
15:38	Leela	No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him. [She picks the thing up.] Aww! I'll call him Nibbler.
15:47	Bender	Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
15:51	Leela	I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
16:12	Zapp	Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys anymore.
16:17	Kif	That's a shame, sir.
16:19	Zapp	So let's make the most of our time together, shall we? [They sit in silence.] Never mind. Just give me a back rub.
16:27	Bender	I found a pair of hermaphlamingos.
16:29	Leela	Good. That's the last species.
16:33	Bender	Hey. What the--?
16:34	Fry	Where'd they all go?
16:43	Leela	Nibbler!
16:44	Fry	I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
16:50	Bender	He's pending for a bending.
16:54	Leela	Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?
17:01	Fry	The planet's kerploding!
17:09	Leela	Prepare for lift-off. [She turns the key in the ignition but the engine doesn't start. The fuel gauge reads empty.] We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left.
17:17	Bender	Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.
17:21	Fry	Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.
17:24	Leela	No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
17:27	Fry	What? What are you talking about?
17:29	Leela	[defensively] Nothing. We just talked.
17:31	Bender	So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him. [Leela hangs her head in shame.] Oh, my God!
17:42	Fry	How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!
17:47	Leela	That's enough! Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
17:51	Fry	No!
17:53	Leela	Alright, alright. I'll call him. [She presses a button and the videophone comes down.] I mean, if living is that important to you.
17:59	Zapp	And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif. ["Incoming Message" repeatedly flashes on the viewscreen.] Hmm.
18:04	Leela	[on screen] Hello, Zapp?
18:05	Zapp	Well, well, well!
18:08	Leela	Zapp, we're out of fuel...
18:10	Leela	[on screen] ...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
18:12	Zapp	So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
18:18	Leela	[on screen] Bird's don't crawl.
18:19	Zapp	They've been known to.
18:21	Leela	Look, are you going to rescue us or not?
18:23	Zapp	[on screen] Can't you ask a little more ... sexfully?
18:29	Leela	[sexfully] Please?
18:30	Leela	[sexfully; on screen] Big Z?
18:32	Zapp	Certainly. But first you'll have to get rid of that thing. [He points at Nibbler] That's the law, Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: Hard and fast!
18:42	Zapp	[on screen] Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you to safety.
18:45	Leela	I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!
18:59	Zapp	[on screen] And which one rocked your world?
19:03	Fry	Wow! Way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
19:07	Leela	Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.
19:10	Bender	Can do!
19:13	Bender	What the hell was that?
19:18	Fry	Pew!
19:20	Leela	I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
19:22	Bender	So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
19:26	Leela	His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little-- [The ship shakes again.] Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine.
20:04	Leela	We made it! [She looks through a pair of binoculars.] And some of the animals survived.
20:09	Bender	So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
20:15	Fry	We're heroes!
20:18	Leela	[thinking] Dear Captain's Diary: I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.
20:32	Zapp	[from inside] Captain's journal: Star date ... uh.
20:35	Kif	[from inside] April 13th.
20:37	Zapp	[from inside] April 13th ... point two.
20:40	Zapp	We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!
