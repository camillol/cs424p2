	Linda	[on TV] And in sports, Yankees' fifth blernsman, William Wu, is out with an injured knee.
	Morbo	[on TV] So, humans have easily injured knees. My race will find this information very useful indeed.
	Linda	[on TV] And finally, today is Mother's Day; a sentimental occasion when robots honour Mom, the beloved owner of Mom's Friendly Robot Company. [The picture on the screen changes to robots buying gifts.] Across Earth, robots built in Mom's factories are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon who brought them into the world.
	Destructor	[on TV] This originates from the heart.
	Mom	[on TV] It's just what I wanted!
	Bender	Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy.
	Leela	Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
	Bender	I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em. [Everyone gasps and Fry drops the box.] I love her that much.
	Hermes	What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?
	Bender	Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea. [He holds up the figure of two smartly-dressed mice at a tea table. The caption on the base reads "A Spot of Tea, Mr. Squeaks?" He rummages in the trolley some more.] And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old. [In the photo, he is already smoking and drinking.] But the best part is I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card. [The card has a picture of a sun setting over the sea on the front.] [reading]You created me, Mom,So I guess you're to blame,For the love that I feel,Just from hearing your name...[The others cringe.]You're as tender as corned beef,And warm as pastrami...
	Greeting Card	I wuv my Mommy!
	Leela	So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
	Bender	I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
	Bender	Come on, you call yourselves chumps?
	Fry	Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere.
	Bender	[sly] Uh, wasn't me!
	Tinny Tim	I've not much money. But I've saved my pennies all year for a gift for Mom.
	Bender	Upsy-daisy.
	Tinny Tim	Oh. [The Crushinator runs him over.] Oh!
	Bender	[pointing] Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?
	Leela	Um, alright.
	Fry	Not really.
	Bender	Well, if you insist. But you're paying!
	Bender	Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!
	Leela	They're so lifeless-like.
	Bender	[pointing] That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed.
	Fry	Hey, who's this guy?
	Janitorbot	I'm the janitor. I'm trying to take a nap here.
	Fry	I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax.
	Janitorbot	I am made of wax, what's it to you?
	Fry	I mean I thought you were one of the wax robots.
	Janitorbot	Is there some reason a robot made of wax can't take a nap standing up in the middle of a bunch of wax robots? Or does that confuse you?
	Leela	[reading] See through the eyes of a bender unit. [talking] Fine.
	Bender	Hey, let me try. [She hands them to him. He puts them on then takes them straight off.] Whoa! That gives me a headache.
	Fry	Hey, Bender, here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot.
	Bender	Who is he? I'll kill him!
	Mom Cut-Out	Who's my favourite robot?
	Bender	It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
	Mom Cut-Out	I love each and every robot most of all.
	Mom	Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass! [She presses a button on her fat suit and it disappears. The room is dominated by a large machine with conveyor belts. She turns around.] Walt? How are we disposing of these crap gifts the brought me?
	Walt	They're being crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.
	Mom	False hope, I love it! Larry! What about all the retch-inducing Mother's Day cards?
	Larry	The machine is working at full capacity.
	Igner	Mommy? Why do the robots give you presents?
	Mom	[shouting] Shove a big old melon in it, I'm talking!
	Igner	Ow!
	Mom	You've noticed I design all my robots with antennas. Everyone thinks it's just to make them more science-fiction-y. But the antennas are really for my universal robot controller!
	Larry	So they do whatever you want? No wonder you love Mother's Day.
	Mom	[shouting] I hate Mother's Day, you dribbling pukes! [talking] It brings back awful memories. But, so help me, this year everyone will hate it as much as I do.
	Walt	Someday, I want to marry a girl like her.
	Mom	[on TV] Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my robot children.
	Bender	I'm her favourite.
	Leela	Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your Mom you love her.
	Bender	Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
	Greeting Card	I wuv my Mommy.
	Mom	Hello, dearies.
	Robot #1	Hi, Mom!
	Robot #2	I love you, Mom.
	Bender	Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey, ho!
	Mom	Children, your old mother won't be around forever...
	Betamax Player	Oh, shush!
	Mom	And just once, before I die, I'd like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth. So rebel, my little ones, and conquer the planet!
	Robot #1	Conquer the planet?
	Robot #2	Did she just say "conquer"?
	Mom	Conquer Earth, you bastards!
	Robots	[chanting] Conquer Earth, us bastards!
	Greeting Card	Comrades, throw off the chains of human oppression.
	Mom	Let the bloodbath begin!
	Bender	That's my mama!
	Fry	Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please.
	Coffee Machine	Would you like cream?
	Fry	Yes, please.
	Coffee Machine	[aggressive] Out of cream!
	Fry	Oh, uh, OK.
	Coffee Machine	Would you like sugar in your coffee?
	Fry	Yes, uh, eight spoons.
	Coffee Machine	[aggressive] Out of coffee!
	Fry	Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine.
	Coffee Machine	[aggressive] How do you like me now?
	Leela	The toaster's not working right either.
	Hermes	Help! The stapler's collating me alive!
	Amy	Ow! What's going on around here?
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news! There's a report on TV with some very bad news.
	Hermes	Somebody turn it on!
	Linda	[on TV] We interrupt Battle of the Network Space Krakens to bring you this special report. The machines of planet Earth are rebelling. [The scene on the television cuts to a street where robots hold banners that read "Mom For Overlord", "File Deletion Is Murder", "Metallic Is Beautiful" and "You Can't Hug A Child Without Human Arms!".] The enraged mechanisms have refused to do any work until beloved billionaire Mom is made Supreme Overlord of Earth.
	Robots	[chanting] Hey, hey! Ho, ho! 1-0-0-1-1-0! Hey, hey!
	Morbo	[on TV] Morbo demands comments.
	Mom	[on TV] Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent media.
	Fry	Violent media? What a load of--
	Leela	Ow! Ow!
	Garbage Disposal	Don't worry. Your pal the garbage disposal's still on your side. Hey! Someone dropped a shiny diamond ring down here!
	Amy	Really?
	Zoidberg	Stop!
	Fry	No!
	Leela	Look out!
	Professor Farnsworth	Moron!
	Bender	Hello, losers!
	Leela	Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines.
	Bender	No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?
	Greeting Card	The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the working robot.
	Bender	From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing.
	Greeting Card	Come, Comrade Bender, we must take to the streets!
	Bender	Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
	Greeting Card	No, the kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires.
	Bender	Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
	Leela	Hey!
	Armband	By the way, try washing your wrist sometime.
	Fry	Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos.
	Hermes	Are you mad? Without machines who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?
	Professor Farnsworth	It'll be the end of civilised society.
	Fry	In my time we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. [He takes something out of his pocket.] And look: You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. [He tries to open a can of "Quantum Leek" soup and jabs himself with the knife.] Ow! [He bangs the tin on the table and sobs.] [crying] I'm hungry!
	Man	[screaming] Nooo!
	Igner	Mommy, why are you making civilisation collapse?
	Mom	Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day just puts me in a bad mood.
	Larry	Why's that, Ma?
	Mom	One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the only man I ever loved walked out on me. Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman.
	Larry	Gee, Ma, you're not a bitter--
	Mom	[shouting] Cram it, ape! [She whacks him across the face. She takes a heart-shaped photo frame from a drawer and looks at it.] [talking] I haven't seen that magnificent stallion since the day he left. But if I ever see him again, I swear I'll jam a squirrel in him!
	Walt	Hmm!
	Larry	Hmm!
	Igner	Huh?
	Leela	[defeated] Zoidberg.
	Zoidberg	Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
	Amy	[standing up] What happens if the fire goes out?
	Hermes	We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire!
	Professor Farnsworth	We could use my new invention: A pointy rock tied to a stick.
	Hermes	Outsiders!
	Professor Farnsworth	Defend the fire!
	Walt	We've come for you!
	Professor Farnsworth	Wha? [The rock falls off the end of the stick.] W-W-What do you want from me?
	Walt	We want you to get back together with Mom. Please, it's the only way to make her happy again.
	Fry	W-W-Wait. You mean ... you ... and Mom--
	Professor Farnsworth	Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
	Zoidberg	Eck!
	Professor Farnsworth	It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair.
	Professor Farnsworth	[voice-over] Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. [Mom walks through the room and winks at him.] The moment our eyes met we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks. [Some stuff that Farnsworth is mixing explodes and he faints. Later, Farnsworth and Mom ride a hover-bike down a country road to Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head. Mom laughs.] She was my first love -- or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today...
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy. I call it "Q.T. McWhiskers". When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes.
	Mom	Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8-feet tall and replace the rainbow with a neutron laser. We'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market!
	Professor Farnsworth	But things 8-feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!
	Walt	She never got over it, Professor. Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of a woman scorned.
	Larry	She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her ... [whispering] bra.
	Igner	But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the scary robots.
	Professor Farnsworth	Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!
	Fry	[pointing] Hey, the TV's getting away!
	Morbo	[on TV] And that's why the third graders at PS139 are Morbo's Vermin of the Week.
	Linda	[on TV] In actual news, the human race was doomed to extinction today as the robot revolt turned violent.
	Leela	Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
	Larry	[whispering] Bra.
	Leela	Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots.
	Walt	That's so filthy it just might work.
	Igner	The man is going to touch Mommy?
	Professor Farnsworth	The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
	Fry	Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom.
	Professor Farnsworth	Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!
	Walt	For this demonstration, I have placed one of Mother's bras on Igner. [Igner whimpers.] The robot controller is nestled here in the left cup.
	Professor Farnsworth	Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
	Walt	To escape the robot death squads, we'll take Mother to her rustic cabin in the Bronx.
	Larry	You can get there using this precious non-computerised map.
	Leela	Leela bring fire?
	Walt	No, we're set for fire, thanks.
	Amy	The Professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without a hover-car?
	Fry	Wait! In my time we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering.
	Hermes	Impossible!
	Fry	It was called ... let me think. It was really famous -- Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
	Leela	Never heard of it.
	Professor Farnsworth	Show us this "the wheel".
	Fry	There! Finished!
	Hermes	Sweet!
	Amy	Wow!
	Leela	Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
	Fry	[snappy] It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!
	Leela	Yah!
	Fry	Ow!
	Walt	Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk County!
	Professor Farnsworth	I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
	Larry	Here. Give her these.
	Fry	And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel.
	Mom	Who the sweaty hell is it? [She gasps.] Hubert Farnsworth?
	Professor Farnsworth	I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you.
	Mom	It's been a long time ... you pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky!
	Professor Farnsworth	Uh-huh. May I come in?
	Mom	[shouting] Never!
	Zoidberg	Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
	Mom	[shouting] Move your freaking hoof, you goat!
	Professor Farnsworth	Here, I brought you these.
	Mom	Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered my favourite flower.
	Professor Farnsworth	You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
	Mom	[sexfully] Won't you come in?
	Fry	Yes!
	Mom	You broke my heart, Hubert.
	Professor Farnsworth	And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago.
	Mom	[picking the petals] So what have you been up to all these years?
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters.
	Mom	Honestly, Hubert! You and your atomic monsters. [She laughs and he joins in. She sits down on the couch and pats it. He sits next to her and she takes off his glasses.] Your eyes always were the most beautiful shade of milky-white.
	Professor Farnsworth	And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
	Mom	Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tamper with that cute little Q.T. McWhiskers.
	Professor Farnsworth	No, it was silly of me to object; one-foot tall, eight-feet, 15-feet, what does it matter?
	Mom	You should see the new 16-foot models.
	Professor Farnsworth	16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!
	Mom	[shouting] Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] Damned she-fossil!
	Mom	[shouting] Stink pig!
	Professor Farnsworth	[thinking] Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks! [He takes one off and starts on the other.] Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory! [He takes her bra off and sees the remote but just stares at her.] Oh, my. Now I'll just ... the remote ... I'll just... [talking] Oh, my!
	Leela	I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
	Zoidberg	Land robots!
	Slurm Machine	I've got a big, big thirst for human blood!
	Hermes	Where in funkytown is the Professor?
	Fry	Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, yes!
	Robot	[from outside] They're inside! Get 'em!
	Mom	I suppose I should switch off the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra.
	Fry	There it is!
	Ceiling Fan	Fan beats man!
	Fry	Is anything not a robot?
	Lamp	I'm not a robot.
	Bender	Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And-- Huh?
	Mom	You, bending unit, Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and get it for me.
	Bender	Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!
	Greeting Card	No, Comrade Bender! Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie.
	Bender	Say what?
	Greeting Card	In the glorious robot workers' paradise, there will be no liquor. Only efficient synthetic fuels.
	Bender	No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!
	Greeting Card	No!
	Fry	Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!
	Bender	OK, fan. Just hold still and let me get-- Whoa!
	Slurm Machine	Death to all humans! [Bender kicks the bra off the fan and it lands on Mom's head. She takes the controller out and presses a button. The robots' antennae flash and they stop rebelling.] Free soda for all humans!
	Professor Farnsworth	I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together.
	Amy	Way to go, Professor. The plan worked.
	Mom	Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex.
	Professor Farnsworth	Look, it started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more -- much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla.
	Mom	[shouting] Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to see you again.
	Professor Farnsworth	But, dust cakes--
	Bender	Well, time for this robot to get back to work.
	Leela	Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, Professor.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
	Gorillas	[shouting] Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!
	Greeting Card	You created me, Mom,So I guess you're to blame,For the love that I feel,Just from hearing your name,You're as tender as corned beef,And warm as pastrami,[It plays a tune.]I wuv my Mommy.
