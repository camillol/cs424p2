	Morbo	So I gave the cookies you made to Fawn and the kids and they couldn't believe it -- they were delicious. But, I digress. [He turns to the camera.] [shouting] Tremble, puny earthlings! One day my race will destroy you all!
	Leela	Could one of you guys get that?
	Leela	It's a doorbell baby! [She crouches down to the bundle of blankets in the basket. Fry and Bender appears behind her.] Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so--
	Bender	Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.
	Leela	Bender, stop! It's a baby!
	Bender	[stamping] A baby what? [Leela kicks him in the head and he falls over.] Ow!
	Leela	Oh, it's just a card. From the orphanarium I grew up in.
	Card	Leela, you're invited to a reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. [The voice changes to an adult woman's voice.] Please stand clear of self-destructing basket.
	Bender	A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?
	Leela	No way, Jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me.
	Kids	[chanting] One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
	Kirk	Nice depth-perception, one-eye!
	Leela	How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!
	Kirk	My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!
	Fry	Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'Oeuvres.
	Leela	Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces.
	Bender	Set a course for adventure!
	Fry	Ew!
	Bender	What a dump!
	Leela	Just like old times. Gosh! The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then. [An old man approaches her from behind. He is dressed in a grey suit and is wearing a grade 135 badge. He clears his throat and Leela turns around.] Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
	Warden Vogel	Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!
	Leela	You used to say that all the time!
	Warden Vogel	Oh, those were happier days.
	Fry	Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
	Bender	And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
	Leela	Hey, look. It's our old group picture.
	Fry	I don't see you anywhere.
	Leela	That's me over in Cootietown.
	Bender	Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
	Leela	That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
	Kids	[chanting] One-eye! One-eye!
	French Guy	Stupid as a French guy!
	Kids	[chanting] One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
	Leela	Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang.
	Man #1	So, whatcha been up to since you left the orphanarium?
	Man #2	Uh, living in a box, fighting the shakes. You?
	Man #1	Selling kidneys, teeth, whatever falls out of me.
	Leela	And what am I up to, you ask? Why, I'm a very successful space captain.
	Man #2	Oh.
	Man #1	Wow.
	Man #3	How nice for you, Leela.
	Woman	That's so good for a person with one eye.
	Leela	Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're a bunch of losers.
	Man #1	Uh, right, right. We're the losers!
	Kirk	Well, if it isn't old one-eye!
	Leela	Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!
	Man #3	He can't hear you. He's deaf now.
	Adlai	Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly normal life. She's not gussied up, duded out, getting down or where it's at. Now run along.
	Leela	Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball-- Oddball!
	Adlai	Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's a fine, conventional profession.
	Leela	Well, you know, it's just for a package delivery service.
	Adlai	Ah-ah. A package is just a box until it's delivered.
	Leela	Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
	Adlai	Oh, I'm a doctor.
	Leela	A tall doctor, you say?
	Warden Vogel	Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you thought about adopting one of our kids?
	Fry	Sure haven't.
	Warden Vogel	Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have a kid without having sex.
	Fry	[thoughtful] Really?
	Warden Vogel	Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week.
	Bender	$100 a week?
	Adlai	I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can fix it so no one ever makes fun of you again.
	Leela	You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
	Adlai	No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye and graft it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll look like a perfectly normal two-eyed person.
	Leela	Me? Perfectly normal?
	Bender	Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.
	Fry	Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?
	Bender	No. It's called "parenting". Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect.
	Boy	Our daddy's a giant toy!
	Professor Farnsworth	Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
	Amy	I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction surgery here ... [She points to her cheek.] ... and here.
	Fry	You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
	Leela	Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal.
	Fry	But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think.
	Leela	You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think! [She stands up.] I'm getting the surgery.
	Professor Farnsworth	That a girl!
	Amy	Right on!
	Zoidberg	Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies.
	Professor Farnsworth	That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard, you imbecile!
	Adlai	Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats. [He starts to pull the bandages off. The staff peer at her closer. Adlai pulls off the bandages and reveals a smiling, two-eyed, blonde woman. The staff gasp.] Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient. [They move to another bed and Adlai pulls off the real Leela's bandages. The others gasp at Leela's new face. The pupil in her left eye falls out.] Oops.
	Amy	Leela, those eyes look so great on you.
	Fry	Bah! I think she looked fine before.
	Professor Farnsworth	No.
	Zoidberg	No.
	Amy	Uh-uh.
	Hermes	Wrong.
	Leela	Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet.
	Adlai	You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it.
	Leela	I did it! I blunk!
	Hermes	And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
	Leela	Hooray!
	Walt	Ow!
	Igner	Ow!
	Larry	Ow!
	Leela	I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
	Bender	Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.
	Kids	[chanting] Hello, jerkbags!
	Amy	Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?
	Bender	Kids have names?
	Nina	My name's Nina, and his name's Albert--
	Bender	And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.! [He takes a piece of paper out of his chest cabinet.] Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!
	Sally	Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
	Bender	What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food! [The kids look sad.] Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food.
	Albert	Can we have Bender burgers again?
	Bender	No. The cat shelter's on to me!
	Adlai	Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawai'ian shirts toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam.
	Leela	Oh. That's so handsome of you.
	Adlai	Just follow the light with your eyes. [He draws the light back and forth in front of her but only the real eye follows it.] Perfect! You know, a guy could fall head-over-heels for a gal like you. [Fry walks behind him and frowns.] As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself.
	Leela	What are you saying?
	Adlai	I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?
	Leela	Sure!
	Adlai	I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.
	Fry	This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
	Leela	You're just jealous!
	Fry	No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!
	Leela	Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life.
	Zoidberg	Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor.
	Leela	Actually, most doctors are rich.
	Zoidberg	What? When did this happen? You're joking, right? [He shakes her.] That's not funny!
	Bender	OK, they've got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back. That's one of the things you kids do, right?
	Albert	Yeah.
	Bender	Then knock yourself out. [The kids scream and run off, eating things and spinning around on bar stools.] Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
	Nina	Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
	Bender	Here.
	Fembot	These kids yours?
	Bender	Yeah.
	Fembot	Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
	Bender	That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun.
	Boy	Daddy Bender?
	Bender	Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!
	Boy	I love you, Daddy Bender!
	Bender	Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!
	Fembot	I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
	Bender	You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it! [The kids cheer.] [grumbling] Oh, come on!
	Adlai	I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary, a place no one could object to.
	Leela	That sounds wonderful.
	Man #4	I'd like an extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
	Adlai	Average, please.
	Leela	Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird.
	Adlai	Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!
	Leela	Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
	Zoidberg	[mesmerised] Totally.
	Adlai	Uh, listen. I just want you all to know your Leela's one standard lady.
	Leela	Oh, Adlai, stop!
	Fry	What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
	Zoidberg	Damn right!
	Fry	And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot. [Farnsworth blubbers and waves.] Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.
	Hermes	Tally me banana.
	Fry	Amy's a klutz from Mars.
	Amy	Sploops!
	Professor Farnsworth	And, Fry, you've got that brain thing.
	Fry	I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?
	Leela	That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
	Professor Farnsworth	She's right!
	Zoidberg	No doubt about it.
	Amy	Duh!
	Hermes	Daylight come!
	Bender	Coming through, watch your heads!
	Zoidberg	Help! I'm under attack!
	Bender	Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right.
	Elzar	Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
	Sam	Me!
	Bender	Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
	Sam	'Bout time!
	Bender	That's my boy!
	Elzar	And here's your check. Bam!
	Albert	I gotta go poopy!
	Bender	Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!
	Elzar	[shouting] You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!
	Adlai	You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me think about kids of our own.
	Leela	Us? Me? You? Kids?
	Adlai	That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and have kids.
	Leela	Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
	Albert	Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.
	Bender	Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry.
	Sally	Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.
	Kids	[chanting] Story! Story! Story!
	Bender	Alright, fine, gather round.
	Nina	We wanna hear this one again!
	Bender	[reading] "Bender's Arrest Record" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting.
	Albert	Yeah, show us the picture! [Bender shows them a picture of him with a stolen watch on his arm. The kids laugh.] There he is!
	Bender	OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed. [The kids groan.] The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.
	Bender	Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps! [He and Fry sit down at a cable spool that has been turned over to make a table. Bender looks over his accounts and mutters.] Oh! I need a calculator.
	Fry	You are a calculator.
	Bender	I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper-- [He gasps.] I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!
	Fry	There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
	Bender	I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
	Sam	Daddy, how do I flush you?
	Bender	[shouting] Just go to bed!
	Adlai	You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you all the more.
	Leela	Adlai, I was thinking, since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.
	Adlai	Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable, it's adequately satisfactory!
	Bender	Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check. [He picks up Albert.] Oh, aren't you a cutie? [He puts him down and picks up the phone.] About 35lbs. [Fry taps his shoulder.] What?
	Leela	Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.
	Bender	Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?
	Adlai	Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.
	Bender	Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.
	Leela	I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
	Albert	I'm Albert.
	Leela	Kind of fatty.
	Bender	Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
	Leela	Uh, um.
	Adlai	Hmm.
	Bender	If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. [He picks up Sally, who is wearing a sash with "As Is" written on her.] Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called "love".
	Sally	One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.
	Leela	Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.
	Bender	OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed.
	Albert	But it's 10 in the morning!
	Bender	I said hit the hay!
	Leela	Oh, they're all so adorable.
	Bender	Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
	Smitty	You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock.
	Bender	If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!
	Leela	Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?
	Smitty	Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.
	Orphan #1	Nice ear!
	Orphan #2	Hey, freaky ears!
	Orphan #3	How's you hearing?
	Leela	I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
	Adlai	Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.
	Leela	Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad.
	Kids	[chanting] Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!
	Adlai	On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her face.
	Leela	Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
	Adlai	Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her acceptable.
	Leela	She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
	Adlai	Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?
	Leela	Damn right I was!
	Fry	Yay!
	Leela	Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age.
	Sally	I also have a tail!
	Leela	Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
	Adlai	Why should I do that?
	Leela	Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is gonna have one eye.
	Warden Vogel	In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!
	Fry	It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
	Leela	Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird.
	Fry	Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.
	Albert	We'll miss you, Daddy Bender.
	Nina	We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture.
	Sally	So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it.
	Bender	Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh! [He screws it up and throws it in his chest cabinet. The kids sigh and walk away. Bender checks they're gone and takes the screwed up paper out of his cabinet and sticks it to the inside of his door. He sighs. The kids cheer, run back and jump on him.] Hey! What the-- Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! [shouting] I hate you! I hate you all!
