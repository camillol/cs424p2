	Linda	Tonight, at 11:00.
	Morbo	Doom!
	Leela	Boy, that thing's big. Fry, is my colossal eye too big?
	Fry	No, it's what makes you you.
	Leela	But it's so round, so hideously round.
	Fry	Leela, listen. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known.
	Leela	Oh. So you only care about my looks?
	Fry	No, I.... What?
	Linda	[on TV.] Finally, New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai, playboy ruler of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, arrived on his extravagant, caviar-powered yacht.
	Nikolai	[on TV.] I'm just a humble emperor, with a big, big crown!
	Bender	[He turns off the TV.] Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!
	Leela	What?
	Bender	True. I've always dreamed of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult.
	Leela	You'd be stupid to try.
	Bender	I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard.
	Amy	Never! [She walks away.]
	Bender	A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires.
	Zoidberg	Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job. [He takes an eel out of a bucket label "Aquariam Garbage" and wraps it around himself like a cravat.]
	Bender	And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested.
	Fry	As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being the chump.
	Bender	Of course, it would all take split-second robotic timing. That's were I come in. You see, I own a watch. [He pulls out a pocket watch.]
	Professor Farnsworth	There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher.
	Amy	Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body?
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life.
	Amy	Like the heaps of dead monkeys?
	Professor Farnsworth	Science cannot move forward without heaps! No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe.
	Amy	I wasted my youth porking out.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, I remember. [He points to a picture of a fat Amy, captioned "2997 employee of the year".]
	Amy	Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry.
	Professor Farnsworth	Funny, I could use a extra meat on my bones. [He moves his coat and shows that he is just skin and bones.] Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust.
	Amy	[She gasps.] We are just the people this mind-switcher was made for by us! [They sit in the chairs.] Wait, can I still change my mind?
	Professor Farnsworth	Let's find out. [He pushes a button.]
	Amy	[in Farnsworth’s body.] It didn't work you doddering old [She gasps.]
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Amy’s body.] Ah! Cartilage! Dude, I bid you a fond cowabunga! I'm off to laugh at the Reaper. [He shuffles off. Cut to a mountain where he is party boarding. He hits a rock face and snow falls on him. Cut to Planet Express. Amy is eating Bologna substitute from a squeeze bottle.] I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is just not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping everything way. Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies.
	Bender	Body switcher, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies.
	Amy	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Professor, what's not happening?
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Amy’s body.] Bad news, me. [He presses a button and a diagram of their brains comes up.] I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response.
	Amy	[in Farnsworth’s body.] You idiot!
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Amy’s body.] Once two bodies have switch minds, they can never switch back. [A dramatic cord plays as Amy covers her mouth.] However, maybe they can. Maybe we can swap back by using a third body.] for temporary storage space.
	Bender	I'm 60% storage space. [He bangs his chassis.]
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Amy’s body.] Eh, wha? [He and Bender sit in the machine and switch bodies.]
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] Well, I'm off to the royal yacht for a quick seduce-and-snatch. [He takes the pocket watch out of the Professor's chest cabinet.]
	Amy	[in Farnsworth’s body.] See ya!
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.]: Now then Amy, we'll simply switch bodies, and then we'll... We'll... No, I'd be back in my body.], but then you and Bender would be switched. And the Amy and Bender bodies can't trade minds again, since they just did.
	Amy	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Oh no! Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.]’’: I'm not sure. I'm afraid we need to use... MATH.
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] Stupid, air-needing lungs. [He climbs onto the boat. He gasps.] The crown jewels. Now I just need to find the guard and seduce him in... [He checks the watch.] Four seconds?
	Basil	Who goes there?
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] [Counting down.] Three, two, one. Hello big boy. [He comes out, imitating porn music and dancing.]
	Basil	Silence! I am Basil, the emperor's cousin and chief of his royal guard. And I will not be seduced by a... [He gets punched and falls down.]]
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] I said, "Wow chica wow wow".
	Leela	Professor, what's the matter.
	Amy	[in Farnsworth’s body.] I'm Amy. The Professor and I switched bodies.
	Leela	Oh, lord.
	Amy	[in Farnsworth’s body.] All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, but I can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon.
	Leela	At least, you get the senior discount at the movies, I hate paying $14 to see Nicholas Cage solve things.
	Amy	[in Farnsworth’s body.] If you want to save $2 dollars, we could switch bodies.
	Leela	We could always switch back, right? [Amy grins.]
	Fry	Hey, Leela. Mmm. What smells saturated?
	Amy	[in Leela’s body.] Deep-fried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed.
	Fry	Woah. That sounds like something Amy would say and eat.
	Amy	[in Leela’s body.] I am Amy. Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine. [She puts ketchup on her "creation".
	Fry	So Leela's in your body?
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Not exactly. [Fry makes a revolted sound.] Aha! You do only like me for my body.
	Fry	That is entirely not true, sir!
	Bender	[in Amy's body.] Now to switch bodies with Zoidberg, sneak past the metal detector and clip the alarm wires, all in less than... [He checks the watch.] Ten minutes ago! Oh! [He throws the watch through the metal detector, setting it off. Alarms sound and lights focus on him. Nikolai walks up behind him and cocks a gun.] Uh, could you come back when my chump gets here?
	Nikolai	Now then, what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht?
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you. I just switch bodies with some bimbo. Go ahead, ask me anything a robot would know.
	Nikolai	Ah, a reverse Turing test, eh? Very good. What is the square root of nine?
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] Hold on, let me just get out a pencil. [He sighs.] Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot. I'm more this kind. [He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking.
	Basil	He steps forwards but moves backwards.
	Nikolai	By the gods! he is a machine!
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.] No, that won't restore everyone, either. Besides, I don't want my decrepit old body back! I'm running away with this invincible robot body and joining something!
	Fishy Joe	I paid for 15 Robot Clowns per cubic meter of car, and you're barely giving me 12. Now crumple up and get in... And fasten your seat belts.
	Robot Clown	Oh, come on!
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.] Good day. I am Nonchalanto, the robot daredevil. And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways.
	Fishy Joe	Hmm. You don't look for foolhardy to me.
	Fishy Joe	That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever done. Your hired! [A robot traipse artist falls to the ground.]
	Nikolai	So you’re a common bending robot with a human peasant roommate?
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] [in Amy’s body.] Oh, crap, that is what I am!
	Nikolai	No, Bender, I envy you. I'm so bored with all of these pretentious trappings. The jewels, the parties, the beautiful robo women.
	Princess Flavia	Hello.
	Nikolai	My fiancée, Princess Flavia. Dearest, meet Bender. He's a robot in the body of Chinese Martian physicist.
	Flavia	How tedious. [She walks off.]
	Nikolai	Oh, to escape this gilded cage for a day.
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] You know, we could trade bodies. I could take over the humdrum royal stuff and you could be an regular Joe for a day. [He stares at the crown.] Or more. Much more.
	Nikolai	In that horrible non-robot body. Sir, I have my standards.
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?
	Nikolai	[He giggles.] Me, posing as a lowly bending unit? How wicked! But wait, I'm supposed to give a speech at the UN tomorrow. Can I trust you to do it?
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] You can trust anything.
	Fry	So now Leela's all crotchety because she thinks I'm not attracted to her in the Professor's body.
	Hermes	You aren't, are you?
	Fry	Of course not! But I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?
	Hermes	A man can give her a toke of her own medicine.
	Fry	Yes! I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me. But it would have to be a really, really disgusting body.
	Zoidberg	Friends! Friends! I've got barnacles on my tuchus! [He shows them.]
	Hermes	The long search is over.
	Bender	[in Amy’s body] Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body.
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] Professor?
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Leela. Amy?
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it.
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Yeah, he said something about running away. Then he ran away.
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] What? Wither?
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] What am I gonna do? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot!
	Wash bucket	Wash bucket full.
	Scruffy	Scruffy's work here is done. [He props up the mop and goes to the couch. He lies down and starts reading Extra-Long Honkers.]
	Bender	[in Amy’s body.] [He looks at Wash bucket calculatingly. Cut to the Professor's lab where he and Wash bucket switch bodies.]
	Bender	[in Wash bucket’s body.] Now to find Emperor Von Richendoof.
	Wash bucket	[in Amy’s body.] Now to find Scruffy. [She walks past Fry and Zoidberg.]
	Zoidberg	Switch bodies? I don't see why not. I also don't see why. [He and Fry switch bodies.]
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] In your face, Leela. [He walks out, past Nikolai and Bender Wash bucket’s body.]
	Nikolai	If you're a bender, why is your body full of fetid water?
	Bender	[in Wash bucket’s body.] If you're an emperor, why don't you shut up? Move over Fry. [He pushes Zoidberg out of his seat and switches with Nikolai.]
	Bender	[in Nikolai’s body.] Well, so long.
	Nikolai	[in Wash bucket’s body.] Wait! Point me to my normal human roommate!
	Bender	[in Nikolai’s body.] That's him there, maybe. [He points to Zoidberg.] Got to go!
	Zoidberg	[in Fry’s body] Robot?
	Nikolai	[in Wash bucket’s body.] Yes, 'tis I, Bender. Do you not recognize your own best friend?
	Zoidberg	[in Fry’s body.] Aha! The guy in this body has a friend! Bender, old pal! It's me, the Fry! [He hugs Nikolai.]
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] But then Nicholas Cage discovered that the real treasure was his family. Yes, I'll hold.
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] Hey, Leela, look! I'm in Zoidberg.
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] [She put a hand over her right eye.] Fry?
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] Oh, you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you? [He makes tentacles come out his armpits.]
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] [She gags.] Not at all. [The door opens. Amy has made Leela's body overweight. She unwraps some butter and eats it.] Amy, stop it! Fry, help! She's turning me into a parade float!
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] Eww! look at her! [Amy leave the room.]
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Oh. So you're so shallow that my body disgusts you if it puts on a little extra weight?
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] That wasn't a little extra weight.
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Admit it! You don't care about the inner me at all!
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] No, you admit it! You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Would not!
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] Oh, yeah? Then I challenge you to a romantic date at Elzar's tonight.
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] It's on.
	Hermes	Sweet ocra of Majorca! You make Fat Albert look like Normal Albert!
	Amy	[in Leela’s body.] I don't know what to do. Do you think I should eat more butter?
	Hermes	I am putting a stop to this, right now! Come on We're switching bodies.
	Amy	[in Leela’s body.] Hermes, no! I'll ruin your body, too!
	Hermes	Three decades of the munchies beat you to it.
	Big Bertha	You make quite a show, young man. [A robot Howitzer rolls in.] You remind me of myself as a young cannon.
	Chainsaw-Eating Robot	Big Bertha is the circus's grande dame. She shoots robots through the air.
	Bertha	[She belches and shoots a robot into the air.] Excuse me. Too much goulash.
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.] I've always wanted to be shot out of something. How about a quick blast after lunch.
	Bertha	Alas, a fine big one like you would shatter my barrel. But, ah, to amaze the crowd once more.
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.] I understand the problem of age, but suppose I could put you into a new body?
	Bertha	Never! I body may be old, but it is mine, and every crack a memory of heavy things shot a long way. [She rolls away.]
	Bender	[in Nikolai’s body.] Ah! I have everything I every wanted. Money, wealth, riches. Yet something's missing. A hot princess with which to get grizzly,
	Flavia	[She walks in front of Bender.]
	Bender	[in Nikolai’s body.] Hello, baby! [She pulls out a gun.] Huh? Hey, what's going on here? And why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me?
	Flavia	Nikolai, you imperial fool! We've been having an affair for 700 years.
	Basil	At long last, I shall kill you, blame the burglar and inherit the throne. [He pulls out a sword. Bender spits the jewels out.]
	Flavia	Farewell, Nikolai.
	Bender	[in Nikolai’s body.] Wait! I'm not Nikolai! I'm Bender, the fabulous body-switching burglar. [He moonwalks.]
	Basil	So you are. However, you do have Nikolai's body, and that's the part we want to kill. [He turns on the sword. It works like a chain saw. Basil forces Bender to back up and fall overboard.]
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] Great food, huh? [He burps out of his gills. The rest of the restaurant groans in disgust,]
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Ew!
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] I'm sorry, Leela. I hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me.
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] No, it only makes you more attractive. [She spits her dentures into her wine glass. Everyone watching groans again.
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] Ew!
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] Not at all. It's just another thing that makes you a very special lady.
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] You mean, like my penis? [Fry gags and a worm comes out of his mouth.] Eh!
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] Admit it! You're disgusted by me!
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] No, you're disgusted by me!
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] I'm as attracted to you as I've ever been!
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Prove it! [They start making out while the other restaurant goers scream. Pan over to Amy, in Hermes's body, watching them. The ice cream she is about to eat falls onto the table.]
	Zoidberg	[in Fry's body.] Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday. [He opens the door and looks inside.] A floor? We live like kings?
	Nikolai	[in Wash bucket’s body.] Kings? Silence! Like you, I'm a common lout. Now fetch me some working-class cognac from our brandy storeroom that you know how to find.
	Zoidberg	[in Fry's body.] [He starts looking in the dishwasher, which he breaks and rips off the wall. Nikolai screams as the kitchen starts to flood.] Relax, Bender. I'll dry up that leak with this heating box. [He rips the oven off the wall and places it where the dishwasher was. Gas starts leaking.]
	Nikolai	[in Wash bucket’s body.] [Finding cigars in a cabinet.] Ah, cigars. Light me up, old friend. [Zoidberg pulls out a lighter. Cut to outside where a fireball shoots out of the building. Bender, in Nikolai's body, runs past. Basil and Flavia are chasing him. Two robots walk in front of Bender.]
	Robot	There you are, Emperor Nikolai. It's time for your speech to the UN
	Bender	[in Nikolai.] The what now? [Laser blasts hit the robots. Bender screams and runs away.]
	Scruffy	Miss Wong?
	Wash bucket	[in Amy’s body.] No, Scruffy, I am Wash bucket. I love you. Wash bucket has always loved you. [They kiss but Scruffy pulls away.]
	Scruffy	It's wrong, Wash bucket. Oh, it would be sweet for a while, but in the back of our minds, we'd know that I'm a man and you're janitorial equipment.
	Wash bucket	[in Amy’s body.] In another city, we could be anyone we want!
	Scruffy	Go. Go now, before I beg you to stay.
	Scruffy	Yep.
	Richard Nixon	Please welcome an insane dictator, and one heck of a bowler, Emperor Nikolai!
	Bender	[in Nikolai.] [He runs on stage.] Thanks, Nixon. How we doing?
	Ambassador	I love you, Your Majesty.
	Bender	[in Nikolai.] Shut up, madam ambassador, I know it. Anyhow, [He clears his throat.] I'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks to say, "I'm done". [The ambassadors cheer.]
	Basil	[He jumps onto the stage and holds Bender at sword-point.] Ladies and gentlemen, this robot is an impostor! [The ambassadors all gasp. The Japanese puts his hand to his translator and listens. After a moment, he gasps. Basil turns on his sword.] I shall enjoy this.
	Bender	[in Nikolai.] Not me.
	Chainsaw-Eating Robot	That devil, Basil, will kill our emperor.
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.] You're Robo-Hungarian?
	Robot Carny	Yes. Our nation's chief export is carnies.
	Bender	[in Nikolai.] If only there was some way I could get to the UN to help.
	Bertha	There is. Get in, Nonchalanto.
	Chainsaw-Eating Robot	Bertha, no! It would kill you!
	Bertha	I have not so much time left anyhow.
	Bender	[in Nikolai.] But you could get a new body! You could live a rich, full life!
	Berha	I am trying to have a rich, full life. [The Chainsaw-Eating Robot lights the fuse.] Long live Robo-Hungary! [The impact breaks Bertha's barrel. She groans and is caught by the Chainsaw-Eating Robot.]
	Bender	[in Nikolai.] Me! Thank God you've come!
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.] [He pulls out his own sword.] This is for Big Bertha. [He missed and gets the sword stuck in a podium.] That is not what I meant to give you for Big Bertha.
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] That was nice.
	Fry	[in Zoidberg’s body.] Oh, yeah. [Leela turns on the TV and sees what is happening in the UN They both gasp. Fry's crest pops up.]
	Richard Nixon	Ow. Ow. Arrooo! [He gets thrown off-stage and his jar shatters.]
	Basil	Thoever you are, you're the bravest robot I've ever seen. [He trips the Professor.] I like killing brave things.
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.] Good, Because I've got 20 of them per cubic meter. [He opens his chest cabinet and the carnies fly out and mow down Basil.]
	Boy	When I grow up, I wanna be a diplomat!
	Bender	[in Nikolai.] Well, if they're is one thing I learned, it's a lesson. I believe this belongs to you. [He reaches into his chest cabinet and takes out a phony crown. He puts it on Nikolai's head.]
	Nikolai	[in Wash bucket’s body.] I shall sell it to help the common folk, now that I understand their misery.
	Bender	[in Nikolai.] Yeah, good luck with that.
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] I must say, Hermes, you've got a smoking-hot body.
	Hermes	[in Leela’s body.] I was inspired by Amy. [Hermes's body has lost most of its fat.]
	Leela	[in Farnsworth’s body.] Wow! How did you do it.
	Amy	[in Hermes’s body.] Well, there I was at Elzar's, eating a nice pork sundae and suddenly, I just lost my appetite. [Leela strokes Fry's mouth flaps.] Forever.
	Sweet Clyde	[He is working on an equation. Q to the E to the D!
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.] So it is possible us all to get back to our original bodies?
	Bubblegum	Stone-cold munching, Prof. Sweet Clyde, characterize your inversion theorem.
	Sweet Clyde	Basically, no matter how permuted-up your minds are, they can be restored using, at most, two extra players. [He and Bubblegum high-five.]
	Professor Farnsworth	[in Bender’s body.] And they say pure math has no real-world applications!
	Sweet Clyde	Everybody back in their zones? [The crew gives various affirmations.]]
	Professor Farnsworth	Ah! My body may be old, but it is mine. Brilliant work, Clyde. You'll win the NBA’s highest academic honor for this.
	Nikolai	Also, I am making you a duke. [He pins a medal to Clyde jersey.] So long filthy commoners.
	Bender	¡Adios! And I'm left with the real jewels safely inside... [He checks his chest cabinet.] His compartment!
	Bender	[Over credits.] All right. I'll need accomplices.
