	Morbo	Previously, on puny Futurama. Mwaah! [he devours the camera]
	Bender	Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men. [He scoops Nibbler's poop and dumps it in his chest.]
	Fry	Bender, I think you might be [visuals cut to Bender running around with a sword, wearing a pot on his head] playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
	Bender	I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
	Dr. Perceptron	Please, send in the patient.
	Bender	Wee!
	Prof. Farnsworth	The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. [She is shocked.]
	Leela	Ouch!
	Fry	Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?
	Leela	Actually, I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.
	Morbo	Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine.
	Leela	My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm. [Cut to shots of the caged Nibblonians, their poop is being harvested and transported through clear pipes.]
	Leela	Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams. Are they treating you okay?
	Nibbler	No, they are force-feeding us so we poop more dark matter. It's horrible. [A chime tings and chickens fly out of a hole at the rear of his cage and he "reluctantly" eats them whole then belches.] Those are good. You've got to help us.
	Nibblonians	Help us!
	Nibblonian	Help us, for God's sakes!
	Leela	Nibbler made a bo-bo.
	Nibbler	But not on my terms. I will not be treated like... Hey, wait, aren't you amazed I can speak?
	Fry	Well, actually, no. You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time.
	Nibbler	Then why did you let me eat Friskies and make bo-bo in a litter box?
	Fry	Well, you're cuter that way.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Cute as a baby's buttocks.
	Leela	So what happened? How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians?
	Nibbler	[He sighs.] It all began 36 years ago... [He looks at his watch.] Now! On the planet Vergon 6. [Fade to the surface of Vergon 6. There are many animals moving around.] (VO:) It was a veritable Eden, brimming with unique and irreplaceable species. [Nibbler eats a tortoise looking animal.] Most of which were delicious. [he belches up the animal's shell.] I was Supreme Fuzzler of a Nibblonian scientific outpost. It was paradise, until they came. One of your DOOP ships struck dark matter, little realizing it was not a natural deposit, but rather centuries of Nibblonian fecal material.
	Fry	The big faecal enchilada. Anyone else hungry?
	Nibbler	The DOOP contracted a ruthless businesswoman to spearhead the mining operation.
	Leela	Let me guess. Mom?
	Nibbler	The very same.
	Fry	Can I also guess Mom?
	Nibbler	To reduce cost she started a new enterprise, Mom's Friendly Robots, to build robot slaves. Remember this was back in the days before Robot Lincoln.
	Mom	Faster, faster!
	Robot Slave	I'm going exactly as fast as you built me to go.
	Mom	Oh, wise guy, huh?
	Robot Slave	Ow!
	Nibbler	Eventually, the planet was mined down to a hollow shell and my people were forced to evacuate. [A Nibblonian ship is shown leaving the planet. Pan over to see Nibbler squatting down in some plants.] Alas, I had eaten a day-old Swinosaur for lunch. And while doing some evacuating of my own, I was left behind. [He makes noises that often accompany bowel movements. Mom is watching him Mom: So, that's where it comes from. We may have a whole new source of Dark Matter on our hands.
	Igner	Eww!
	Nibbler	As it turned out I was the lucky one. [The Nibblonian ship is seen entering Mom's ship.] Unbeknownst to me, Mom captured my colleagues and enslaved them here in this... this... crap farm.
	Nibblonian	There's nothing to do but eat and crap, eat and crap. It's like visiting my parents.
	Nibbler	As for me, I emerged from behind the "bush of many uses" to find I had been left behind. I was doomed, doomed.
	Leela	Hello, there.
	Nibbler	Startled, my cuteness reflex kicked in.
	Leela	I'll call him Nibbler.
	Nibbler	A silly name for a high-ranking Fuzzler. But, hey, I was glad to be rescued. [Flashback Nibbler watches Vergon 6 explode.]
	Nibbler	I was kidnapped yesterday by Mom's vile sons in their moronic disguises.
	Igner	I was an owl exterminator. [They turn around. Igner is pointing a gun at them.] Do you have the crysal?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's pronounced "crystal," you lump.
	Igner	Go, run fast. [He points at the large pipe labelled "Primary Chicken Valve." A marching is heard and the door opens. Walt, Larry and many Killbots enter the room.]
	Igner	Me?
	Walt	Yes, you. You're the only one here.
	Igner	If I'm the only one here, then how could I see anyone?
	Larry	He's got a point, Walt.
	Walt	So does my knee.
	Fry	This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens.
	Nurse Ratchet	Don't worry, those clamps are for my own protection.
	Dr. Perceptron	Do you know where you are, Bender?
	Bender	Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches.
	Dr. Perceptron	Close. You're in the loony bin for a robotomy. [He begins drilling through Bender's eye.]
	Dr. Perceptron	Either way is fine.
	Bender	[He sniffs.] Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?
	Mom	Wherever you are, Farnsworth, my boys will find you. [She pans over the security monitors on her desk. Her three sons approach her.]
	Larry	Mom !
	Mom	If the crystals get within six inches of each other... [She slaps Larry.] Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.
	Mom	Get them!
	Leela	[Swings over to the top of the incline the brothers are trying to scale and slides down, boot first, at them. She kicks them and then slides across the icy floor. The collar is emitting a shock.] Ooh. That feels good.
	Mom	Oh, for crying out... [She fires at Farnsworth, but the shots quickly whither away to nothing.] Oh, the freaking battery's dead. Walt, where's the charger?
	Walt	In the hardware drawer, Mother. [Leela punches him and she is shocked.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	We're almost there. The crystals are beginning to engorge. [Leela and the brothers are trying to battle on ice, Mom is trying to untangle the charger and Fry is hanging onto Farnsworth as he leans closer to the single non-local metaparticle crystal.] I can't quite reach. Fry, grab onto my easy-fit waistband. Just a few more inches. Come on, really wedgie it on in there. [Fry pulls harder on the underpants and they rip, sending Farnsworth toward the ground. He, somehow, lands on his feet.] So, that's why they call me the Catman. [Fry lands behind him.]
	Fry	Save us, Catman.
	Mom	It's over, Hubert. Give me the anti-backwards crystal.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Never! [He eats the crystal and begins to chuckle. The crystal glows in his stomach, along with the keys to the ship.]
	Farsnworth	No! [Mom laughs.]
	Bender	Cornwood! [Purple waves expanding from Bender's head fills the screen and Bender vanishes in a bright flash.]
	Nurse Ratchet	But, Doctor, I love you. [Dr. Perceptron's head explodes.]
	Frydo	This is crazy. Ow! What the... You okay, Leela?
	Leegola	I think so.
	Frydo	Wait a second. Is there something different about your hooves? [He gasps.]
	Frydo	Where the hell are we, hell?
	Frydo	Bender?
	Titanius Anglesmith	I know not of this Bender. I'm Titanius Anglesmith. Welcome to Cornwood!
	Titanius Anglesmith	Wretched peasants, put aside your cares and feast on the succulent flesh of the roast munchkin!
	Peasent Cook	Care for a slice of scroto?
	Frydo	Uh... that's his name, right?
	Peasent Cook	'Tis also that, sir.
	Titanius Anglesmith	We're honored this eve by a visit from my friends of old, Frydo and Leegola. So let the dwarves do their gay dance and let the gnomes play their sissy piccolos. [They begin dancing and music is played.] Dance! Dance, you little freaks. Faster. [The music speeds up.] Faster! [The dancing and music speeds up more and a dwarf trips and falls toward Titanius Anglesmith.]
	Titanius Anglesmith	To the kitchen with him !
	Dwarf	Wait! Wait! Wait! I do impressions. Behold! The swamp hag: "Get out of my swamp, you kids!"
	Titanius Anglesmith	Don't let him get too crispy.
	Calculon	Lord Anglesmith.
	Titanius Anglesmith	You have ridden hard, noble squire. May I offer you a horn of ale and a shank of dwarf?
	Calculon	'Tis dire news, sire. Dark riders approach.
	Titanius Anglesmith	[He gasps.] You shall be handsomely rewarded, sir knight. We ride at once! [He pulls one of two ropes in front of a sign labelled "Drawbridge" and Calculon is squished by the drawbridge.] Oops! [He pulls the second rope and the drawbridge flips over to the other side.] Frydo! Saddle up that trusty steed.
	Frydo	What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?
	Titanius Anglesmith	Foul beast-bags! Meet thy doom!
	Waltazar	Follow me.
	Waltazar	Damn thee, Ignus.
	Larius	Well, you said to follow you.
	Waltazar	Well, now I say follow this! [He hits Larius with the handle of his lance. Frydo falls to the ground and drops the Die of Power on the ground.]
	Waltazar	Oh, no!
	Titanius Anglesmith	I'm back bab-... [He gasps and falls to his knees as he watches the die roll.]
	Waltazar	No! No!
	Larius	I got to say, I had no idea the Die of Power was so powerful.
	Waltazar	Did you have any idea of... [He backhands Larius.]
	Leegola	I can't believe I'm saying this, but that was really exciting. I've never felt so alive. [Frydo makes death noises.] What else can we slay? Is that a hobbit over there?
	Frydo	Thank God, an outhouse.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Hush! This be no outhouse, but the lair of the great wizard Grayfarn.
	Greyfarn	Who is it? [He opens the door.]
	Greyfarn	Just a moment. [He closes the door.]
	Greyfarn	Come in! Come in! Yes. 'Tis a powerful object in both our worlds. If you failed to destroy it in yours, perhaps you were brought here that you might have a second chance.
	Frydo	So, this land is real?
	Greyfarn	Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here, you'll really be dead. But instead of science, we believe in crazy hocus-pocus. It's like Kansas.
	Leegola	God help us.
	Greyfarn	Cornwood's troubles began hundreds or perhaps millions of years ago. (VO:) Deep in the Geysers of Gygax, Momon herself injection-molded the Dice of Power from the living plastic.
	Momon	(in flashback): [She picks up the freshly molded dice and begins laughing.] Damn, these are hot.
	Leegola	Ah ha! In our universe she's called Mom.
	Greyfarn	In your universe, are you taught not to interrupt? Evidently not. Anyway, Momon spawned three rotten sons, whom you've already had the displeasure of meeting. Waltazar, Larius, and the dumbest of all, the halfwit Ignus, bastard son of Momon and the brainless He-demon. Curse you, Momon, queen of all that is evil and not very good in bed. And I'm not just saying that because she dumped me. [Fade to flashback. Momon is plucking her eyebrows with a scorpion while Greyfarn is playing a euchalali.] (VO:) Yes, I was once her consort. I was blinded by love, and later, scorpion venom. [Momon squirts venom in his eyes.] I'm blind! (Out of flashback:) But Momon has one weakness. She put too much of her power into this. The generalissimo of dice. [He places the black Die of Power on a table.]
	Frydo	Like that machine that makes wax lions at the zoo.
	Greyfarn	Quiet, you. We must infiltrate the Geysers of Gygax, the impenetrable stronghold of Momon.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Impossible. Impossible, I say.
	Greyfarn	No, Titanius. For we maintain one advantage, the element of surprise. [Pan over to the die, Momon is watching through it while laughing.]
	Hermaphrodite	Stop right there.
	Frydo	Hermes?
	Leegola	He's a centaur like me.
	Frydo	You wish.
	Hermaphrodite	I am Hermaphrodite, most beautiful of centaurs. Gaze upon me and weep at my loveliness.
	Greyfarn	Very well.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Loveliest of centaurs, we seek to end Momon's reign of evil. Have you stout fighters at your command?
	Hermaphrodite	One thousand archers of truest aim. [Pan over to many archers standing on a hill.] Fire!
	Titanius Anglesmith	Hey guys, I forgot I had this pumpkin. [He holds up the pumpkin and the archers' arrows carve it into a sculpture of Titanius. One more arrow comes in on fire and lights the jack-o-lantern.]
	Female Centaur	We centaurs are creatures of peace.
	Leegola	Oh, Lord.
	Hermaphrodite	Violence is never justified. We shall not join your quest. And furthermore, if mayhem be your intent, you may not cross our lands.
	Leegola	Or what?
	Hermaphrodite	[He is intimidated.] Or... Uh... Mmm?
	Greyfarn	We're not there, we're here.
	Titanius Anglesmith	No, this way.
	Greyfarn	I mean, here.
	Greyfarn	Thank you, kindly, Treedledum.
	Treedledum	Okey-doke. Anything else I can do?
	Leegola	You know who I'm gonna miss? That tree guy.
	Greyfarn	Bad news, fancy men. Momon's guards stand watch at the pass. 'Tis as if she somehow anticipated us.
	Titanius Anglesmith	And so our quest comes to an end. I only regret not giving up sooner.
	Greyfarn	Fret not, Titanius. For we still have one hope, the Cave of Hopelessness.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Let me know how that turns out.
	Ogre	Halt. Are you on the list? I'm not seeing you on the list.
	Leegola	I'll split this doofus in half.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Wait, I got it. Yeah. My cousin's in the band. The band of merry men. Please, we were already in there. I just need to go back for my coat.
	Gynecaladriel	I am Gynecaladriel, queen of the water nymphos.
	Leegola	All right. I'll split this doofus in half.
	Gynecaladriel	Stand aside and I will use my powers to overwhelm the guard. [Time cut, the four of them are standing at the entrance. Gynecaladriel walks out from behind a bush where the ogre is asleep and ties up her top.] Behold, the deed is done.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Hi oh!
	Frydo	Mr. Wizard, why is this place called the Cave of Hopelessness?
	Greyfarn	Oh, fear not, lad. 'Tis named for its discoverer, Reginald Hopelessness...
	Frydo	Whew!
	Greyfarn	...the first man to be eaten alive by the Tunneling Horror.
	Frydo	What's that? The Tunneling Horror?
	Gynecaladriel	No, it's morcs.
	Morcs	Hey, listen. Nanu, nanu. Shazbot.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Oh, God, no. They're so aggravating.
	Morcs	Oh, fantastic. Nanu, nanu. Reality, what a concept. Fantastic. [During the killing, Gynecaladriel ends up kissing a mork.] Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
	Gynecaladriel	Shut up! Shut up!
	Morcs	Oh, fantastic. Oh, fantastic. Oh, wonderful.
	Frydo	Maybe it'll go away if we just don't laugh at it.
	Titanius Anglesmith	It doesn't.
	Morcs	Nanu, nanu. [Leegola turns away from the tunnel.] Oh, shazbot. [She kicks the last mork with her back hooves.]
	Zoidberg	Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling.
	Leegola	Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you. [she shoots an arrow into his chest and he snaps it off.]
	Leegola	Mutilate! [She draws her sword and begins stabbing his belly.]
	Leegola	I'll kill you and eat your heart, you abomination. [She slices his chest open, pulls out his heart and tears a chunk out with her teeth.]
	Leegola	I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror.
	Zoidberg	What? I'm not the Tunneling Horror. I hate that guy. Always with the tunneling. Anyway, I'm dead. [He lays back down.]
	Zoidberg	Oh! There he goes again.
