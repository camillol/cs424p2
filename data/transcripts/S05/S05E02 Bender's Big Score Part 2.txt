	Nudar	Stand back you wing wangs. I'm gonna try out this timesphere with a quick test drive to yesterday.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Bushwah. You can't go mucking about in the past without creating paradoxes.
	Nibbler	I'm afraid he can. It's a paradox correcting time code. It all works perfectly. Except when it rips open the universe. Don't do it, I beg you ...
	Nudar	Yesterday please, and make it snappy.
	Crew	wha???
	Nudar	Hello.
	Nudar-2	Howdy.
	Bender	Hey! What the ...?
	Zoidberg	There was one, but now there's two.
	Nudar	Nothing gets past you eagle eye. I went back to last night and met the me of that time for a drink. One thing led to another and we ended up at my place, or should I say our place.
	Leela	Blech.
	Nudar	Oh come on ya bunch of prudes.
	Prof. Farnsworth	This isn't merely revolting, it's impossible to boot. I know a paradox when I see one.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Whaaa?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ahh, paradox resolved. Someone get a mop.
	Dwight	You're looking well pops.
	Hermes	How can you look me in the eye 'n eye and say that? I'm nothin' but a brain. A useless, filthy brain.
	Barbados Slim	You forgot lice infested.
	Hermes	I didn't forget it, I just chose not to .... [gasps] Barbados Slim! What are you doin' here? IS there somethin' goin' on between you two?
	LaBarbara	Oh no no no no, we jus' ah happened to run into each other shortly after your accident.
	Slim	And every night since then.
	LaBarbara	You're so crazy.
	Hermes	Woman! No! Ohh, who am I kiddin'? Without my body, I'm a nobody.
	LaBarbara	I'm sorry Hermes. But look at Barbados. You can't argue with those luscious pecks.
	Hermes	No I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face.
	Slim	I'm not wiggling them. They do that by themselves.
	Nudar	I think I'll go back in time and steal the Liberty Bell before it cracked. Or is the crack the valuable part?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I don't know you naked crook.
	Fleb	[reading from "A Brief History of Time Travel"] We have a problem Nudar. It's a one way time code. It can take us to the past, but it can't bring us back to the present.
	Bender	Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on. Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun.
	Nudar	Hey, that's perfect. We sit back and let dum dum here do the stealing.
	Bender	Dum dum away. Zero zero one one ....
	Leela	The Mona Lisa!
	Bender	Sorry, it's not quite finished.
	Schlump	: Da Vinci give you any trouble?
	Bender	Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Hahahahahaha.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Preposterous twaddlecock. Time travel is impossible.
	Fry	But Professor, you time traveled yourself, remember, when we went back to Roswell?
	Prof. Farnsworth	That proves nothing. And furthermore, you'd think I'd remember a thing like that. Plus, who are you anyway?
	Bender	Man, this is fun on a bun. Here I go again.
	Nibbler	Oh no you don't.
	Bender	Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!
	Bender	Boo! Hahahaha. Naw, it's just me, Bender.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I must tell you Hedonismbot, I hate to sell my doomsday devices to a private collector. But with my business stolen I have to make ends meet. You will be careful?
	Hedonismbot	I shan't touch them until I've had Jambi lock the absinthe and ether away. Ohhhh, what does this one do?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Uh, that one kills everything everywhere.
	Hedonismbot	How delightful. And this one?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Sir! The sphereoboom is not for sale.
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's my sentimental favorite.
	Hedonismbot	No need to explain. I too have known unconventional love. Perhaps you and I, and Jambi, could get together and compare notes sometime, eh?
	MC	... resulting in peace between east and west coat rappers ...
	MC	Good god!
	Bender	I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. Sk√•l!
	Bender	Not so neutral now, are you Sweden?
	Leela	Be honest with me. Does my eye look monstery? I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars.
	Hermes	At least a monster has a body. What I wouldn't give for Wolfman's torso, or any of the groovy ghoulies.
	Leela	Ohh, I think I'll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter.
	Fry	I'd like to punch Lars right in his ruggedly good looking face!
	Nudar	Like all rich people, we're gonna need weapons to shoot poor people.
	Schlump	In self defense?
	Nudar	Yes, that too. Bender, go steal the doomsday device chained to the professor's wrist.
	Bender	Never! Ha ha, I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say.
	Nudar	Here, swap this for the real one.
	Bender	Ahhh! The old switcheroo.
	Nudar	Yes, but don't wake him. You'll need jeweler's tools and foot cup silencers.
	Bender	Hey, I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do. Bender knows when to use finesse.
	Bender	Here ya go.
	Nudar	Put it in the safe, clanky.
	Zoidberg	Owww!
	Bender	Wheeeeeeee.
	Zoidberg	It's the damdest thing ...
	Zoidberg	... there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, well, these things happen. Fortunately the sphereoboom is still safe.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Scammed? Me!? Sweetheart?!? Ohh!
	Hermes	You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg. Tell me, If I could find an undamaged body, could you recapitate me?
	Zoidberg	Hermes, I'm a surgeon. When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens.
	Hermes	Hmmm.
	Hermes	All I'm askin' is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me.
	Bender	What do I do with your old head?
	Hermes	I don't care in the slightest.
	Bender	[brandishing bloody hack saw] Can do!
	Hermes	Come on, mon!
	Zoidberg	[pouring some liquid from Hermes' jar into the bowl] Hermes, please. You can't hurry a delicate operation like this.
	Hermes	Ohh! ... Ug! ... Argh! ... Ahhhhhh. [looking down] What are those?
	Hermes	You incompetent crab!
	Zoidberg	I thought you were happy, your tail is wagging.
	Hermes	Grrrrrr....
	Prof. Farnsworth	I believe this paradoicality equation to be unsolvable, ergo time travel is impossible. But I can't quite prove it, Bubblegum. Perhaps you and your razzle dazzle Globetrotter calculus could ...
	Bubblegum	[interrupting] Looks pretty damn solvable to me, Farnsy. Sweet Clyde, use variation of parameter and expand the Wronskain.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Shizz, baby. So paradox free time travel is possible after all.
	Bubblegum	Right on. But dig this multiplicand here.
	Prof. Farnsworth	The doom field? That must be what corrects the paradoxes.
	Curly Joe	When that momma rises exponentially, it could rupture the very fabric of causality.
	Nibbler	That's what I've been trying to tell you.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hermes, you got your body back. Hurrah!
	Hermes	Yes, but not the original. Bender went back in time and picked up a copy.
	Bubblegum	A copy! Funky cold medina. According to this equation, a time travel duplicate results in a complex denominator in the causality ratio.
	Sweet Clyde	Oh Snap! Bet you know what that means.
	Hermes	I can guess. Actually, I can't guess.
	Bubblegum	Prof, you got a doom meter in this lab.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[looking at doom meter showing nearly 1000 millidooms] Good Lord, Bubblegum. The duplicate body is emitting doom at ten times the back ground level.
	Bubblegum	I thought as much. A duplicate body is always doomed. It's just a matter of time.
	Hermes	I don't care. I just need it long enough to bird dog in an win LaBarbara back.
	Bubblegum	Best bird dog fast my brother.
	Hermes	That the way I bird dog best.
	Lars	Drink, quick. I can't balance it much longer.
	Leela	Wait .. I .. [Leela drinks]
	Lars	Yes!
	Leela	This is so much fun Lars. Most men are intimidated by the fact that I could kill them with the flick of my wrist.
	Lars	Well not me. 'Cause if you do, you'll be stuck with the check.
	Elzar	[with a spice weasel] Folks, care for a little fresh ground executive?
	Leela	Please.
	Elzar	Bam!
	Elzar	Don't get excited kids, this thing's got heart shaped nostrils. Want to see it make a star?
	Leela;Lars	No!
	Bender	Here's your Gutenberg Bible master. Plus the Colonel's secret recipe: Chicken, Grease, Salt.
	Fleb	Well, that does it. We've got every valuable object in history.
	Fry	Owww!
	Nudar	Hmm. Now that I'm rich I suddenly care if the universe gets destroyed. We can't use that dangerous time code again. Blank it from the robot's memory.
	Bender	Ahhhhh.
	Nudar	[looking at Fry] I'll vaporize this guy so his ass doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
	Fry	Why don't you just remove my tattoo?
	Nudar	Nice try. But you might have memorized it.
	Fry	No I mighn't. I can't even remember my mother's maiden name.
	Nudar	It's Gleisner.
	Fry	[running] Stupid naked aliens. Stupid Lars. I hate the future.
	Fry	Hmmmm!
	Bubblegum	Man, that cube root was a real buzzer beater, Clyde.
	Fry	Zero. One. One. One. Zero. Zero. One. One!
	Schlump	Blast him.
	Bender	Ha ha! You missed! Oh great master.
	Fry	Hello 2000. I'm home.
	Voice	(OC) Happy New Year, naked weirdo!
	Fry	Happy new year.
	Nudar	Well, we'll never know where the ass guy went, and since we can't kill him, I say live and let live.
	Bender	Aww, that's sweet boss. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000.
	Nudar	What?! How do you know he went to the year 2000?
	Bender	That's where he always goes.
	Nudar	Hmm. Better play it safe. Go there a little earlier and wait for him. You know what to do.
	Bender	You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator?
	Nudar	Yes. And don't forget to terminate him.
	Bender	Got it. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!
	Schlump	What's with the doofy sun glasses?
	Bender	It's really bright in the past. [Recites the time code]
	Bender	Ok, Fry. Come ta poppa. ... Man I'm bored. [spots beer] Ohhh!
	Bender	Hey, there you are! ... Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Offf. That cheap beer really goes right through you. For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry. Ohhhh unless ....
	Bender-2	... and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Huh! Ah! Wha?
	Bender	Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom.
	Bender-2	Ok Boss. After I kill Fry you're next.
	Bender	What?
	Bender-2	Nothing.
	Bender-2	What the? Who are you?
	Bender-3	I'm Bender from way at the end. I came back to put this rub-on time code on Fry's ass.
	Bender-2	So what are you now, a butler? Spot of tea please, jerkwad!
	Bender-3	It's called class, you yokel. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a buttocks to tattoo.
	Fry	Hello 2000. I'm home.
	Voice	(OC) Happy New Year, naked weirdo!
	Fry	Happy new year.
	Bender-2	Hasta la vista, meatbag!
	Fry	Bender? What are you doing? It's me, your best friend.
	Bender-2	Must obey orders. Ohhhhh. Mustn't kill friend!! Ohhhhhh!!! Badly want to urinate!!!!!
	Fry	What's happening? Are you urinating?
	Bender-2	[monotone] Entering auto destruct sequence. [normal] Awww crap, I hate auto destruct sequence! [monotone] Explosion in seven, six, ...
	Fry	It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.
	Bender-2	[monotone] five .. [normal] Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!
	Bender	Hey ... so the game of cat and mouse begins, huh? Let us match wits. .... Ohhhh, how am I supposed to find him? All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the twentieth century. If only I'd paid the slightest bit of attention. Oh well, guess I'd better go kill myself.
	Cryogenicist	Hello, bartender? I have thought it over, and far from being a fat pig, you are very nice and I would like another drink ...
	Bender	Take a barf buddy. Ok suicide booth, give me your best shot. Electrocution please, side order of poison. [taps foot] Helloooo? Kill me you stupid machine. ... What the ... local calls fifty cents? It's a street corner telephone parlor! Oh what kind of horrible suicide free time is this? Wait a minute, maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down.
	Bender	One of these Frys must be Fry. Look out Philip Fry, 'cause I got a little present for you.
	Fat Man	My name is Phillip Fry. Where's my present.
	Bender	Hang on a second Fry. I don't remember you being that ugly.
	Fat Man	Oh no, I've always been this ugly.
	Bender	Huh. Let me see your ass. [He looks at the fat man's buttocks.] No tattoo. Okay, you can go.
	Fat Man	Farewell sir.
	Bender	Say your prayers, Fry.
	Michelle	This isn't Fry. I kicked Fry out two hours ago. This is my new boyfriend ... uhhh ...
	Constantine	Constantine.
	Michelle	Really? That's a dumb name. Ewwww.
	Bender	Hmmm, could be a trick. Let me see your ass, Constantine. [He looks at Constantine's buttocks.] Ohh, nice, now I see why she left Fry.
	Bender	Okay, you're still clean. I mean metaphorically.
	Bender	He must have left the city. Man, this could take all day.
	Phil	The returns are looking good, Mr. Gore.
	Al Gore	Thanks, Phil. Here's to four years of clean air, clean government, and amazing new technologies such as ...
	Al Gore	... ROBOT!
	Bender	[racking pump on gun] Philip Fry?
	Transition Announcer	Twelve years passed. Then ...
	Transition Announcer	... this.
	Bender	Philip J. Fry?
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Phil, some kind of trash can here to see you. He's coming.
	Philip J. Fry II	Are you made of Tinkertoy?
	Bender	Hmmm. It's been twelve years. Maybe I'm getting taller.
	Philip J. Fry II	You're not getting smarter.
	Bender	Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J. Fry or not? 'Cause if you are, I'm here to kill you.
	Philip J. Fry II	I'd like to see you try.
	Philip J. Fry II	[screams] You want Uncle Phil. He went to the North Pole on a fishing boat.
	Bender	Ahhhh! The North Pole? I was just there.
	Bender	One ticket to the North Pole, please, broom closet class. [Gasps as a bearded figure descends a boarding ramp from a ship] Fry? If only I could be sure. [The figure's pants sag, revealing the Bender tattoo] It is him, I'd recognize me, and hence him, anywhere.
	Bender	Follow that guy. There's an extra hundred in it for you if you follow him so close that you run him over.
	Al Gore	(cab driver) Yes sir.
	Al Gore	Dang. That hundred dollars could have bought me one gallon of gas.
	Bender	Ohhh! I lost him. People will call me a failure. [sees Fry in a second floor window] Others however will call me the world's sexiest killing machine who's fun at parties. Fry, old buddy, it's me, Bender.
	Bender	Wooo! I totally killed him. [laughs then cries] Oh god, what have I done?
