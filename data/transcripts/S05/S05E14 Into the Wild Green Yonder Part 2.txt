	Zoidberg	and Zoidberg: Previously, on Futurama. [they clink champagne glasses labelled "matter" and "anti-matter" together, causing an explosion]
	Hutch Waterfall	You need one of these doodangs. [He taps on his foil hat.]
	Fry	A foil hat? [Hutch puts his foil hat on Fry's head and the voices quiet.]
	Hutch Waterfall	Truth is, you're a mind reader.
	Fry	Oh, my God!
	Amy	You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife? [Bender and Fanny are seen making out]
	Bender	Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave.
	Fry	Poor Bender left me one last voicemail before the Robot Mafia buried him in the desert.
	Bender	Fry, old friend, before I die, I just wanted to say... [Beep.] Hang on, I'm getting another call. Hello? [The gun fire commences and Bender screams.]
	Hermes	Line up, people! Everyone take a shovel and one sixth of the planet. We'll meet back here in 50 years, our bodies broken and our lives wasted.
	Zoidberg	And you say these are free shovels?
	Bender	I'm back, baby.
	Fry	Bender! I thought the Robot Mafia killed you.
	Bender	Nah, they just shot us and buried us a few times as a warning.
	Fanny	Bender was so brave. He never stopped making out with me the whole time they were shooting us.
	Bender	I sure didn't.
	Fanny	I gotta get back to my husband, baby. Will I see you tonight?
	Bender	Probably not.
	Mr. Wong	It's a 14-footer with a clown hazard. What club you recommend, Baggy?
	Fry	Your golf club sure is classy, Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy.
	Leela	It is very nice. I just wish Amy and I didn't have to wear these sexist badges on our melons. [They stand up and show their badges that say "WOMAN."]
	Amy	We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela. Dad's club has a very strict "No girls allowed" policy.
	Leela	That doesn't seem fair.
	Amy	It really is. Everybody knows women don't have the focus to play miniature golf at a professional level.
	Leela	But that's the best shot of the day!
	Mr. Wong	Is that my ball? I think that my ball.
	Amy	Pfft, great putt, Dad.
	Mr. Wong	Okay, we're done.
	Leela	Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place so green in the middle of the desert? Doesn't that waste a lot of water?
	Mr. Wong	Nah, we got plenty water, pumped directly from flamingo lake. [The flamingos sitting in the lake are sucked into the drain with all of the water.] They'll be fine. [Pink feathers are expelled from the sprinklers.]
	Mr. Wong	Oh, yeah, I love miniature golf. Love everything about it, except how damn miniature it is. That's why I'm building the universe's biggest miniature golf course.
	Mr. Wong	This the first tee.
	Fry	Where's the hole?
	Mr. Wong	On Pluto's moon, Hydra. It's a six-billion-mile par-two. Tough shot, even for a man. [Leela groans. Mr. Wong adjusts the cannon with a dial near the tee. He strikes the button that fires the ball and everybody rushes over to a row of binoculars.] (Leo VO): Around the sun. Bank off Jupiter. And right into the... [The ball lands short of the hole and Mr. Wong curses in Mandarin.] I'll be right back. [He gets in a golf cart that has a dome over it and flies to Hydra. Fry, Leela and Amy watch from the binoculars. Mr. Wong smacks the giant ball his his putter, but it stops on the edge of the hole. He growls and curses in Mandarin. He bounces over to the ball and smacks his with his putter again, then kicks it.] It dropped in! Put me down for a two.
	Amy	Two. [She writes down 8.]
	Mr. Wong	Keep in mind, that just the first hole. For full course, we gonna bulldoze this entire arm of the Milky Way.
	Leela	What? You're gonna wipe out 10% of the galaxy for a stupid golf course?
	Mr. Wong	First of all, it 12% . Second, yes, you betcha.
	Leela	But you have no idea what life forms might be evolving out there.
	Mr. Wong	That's exactly why I'm hiring an impartial scientist to perform an environmental survey. That's him in the money shower.
	Fry	Delivery boy's log. Having fallen asleep on what I thought was the toilet, I awoke to find the environmental survey in progress.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Status reports, Science Officer.
	Bender	Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence. [He laughs.] (Telepathically): Just like Fry on a date.
	Fry	[He laughs.] Hey!
	Leela	Okay, so we haven't found any life yet. I still don't see why you men can't be happy with regular-sized miniature golf.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Leela, evolution has programmed our fabulous male brains to take anything anybody else thinks is important and make it bigger. [He takes a slurp of a "128oz. Big Burp."] Have you seen my new 301-inch TV?
	Announcer	Hypnotoad is brought to you by the MagnaPhallix 302-inch TV. It's bigger!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, hell! [He throws his beverage at the TV and it falls apart.]
	Bender	[An alarm sounds.] Captain, I'm detecting life on the spock-o-scope!
	Leela	It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
	Fry	Except in Kansas.
	Bender	But isn't Mr. Wong building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Indeed so. This whole area will be incinerated when he implodes that sun there into a black hole.
	Leela	That beautiful violet star?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's so you can't keep your ball at the end of the game.
	Fry	Yo, that's messed up.
	Leela	There won't be any imploding once they read our environmental review. Right, Professor?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ohh, twaddle-squat. There's no scientific consensus that life is important.
	Bender	Yeah. Life, schmife.
	Clip Board	[Farnsworth checks an option.] Approved for demolition.
	Leela	It's you and me, ponytail. [He cracks her pony tail like a whip.]
	Guard	We're here, Mr. President.
	Richard Nixon	Arroo! Let's play some mini-golf.
	Richard Nixon	Just give it a light tap, Agnew. [Agnew pulls his club up high.] No, no, no, just a light...
	Zoidberg	Now for a triple clam dip, with a double - [The ball smashes into his head and knocks him on his back.] OW! [He falls off the diving board and lands on the concrete surrounding the pool.] OW!
	Richard Nixon	Tough luck, Agnew. Looks like you and Wong owe me a Charleston Chew. [He laughs.]
	Feministas	Shut up and hear our wisdom. Save the ecosystem. Shut up and hear our wisdom!
	Richard Nixon	What gives, Wong? You said no chicks allowed.
	Frida	We are the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you...What was it again?
	Leela	We will not let you implode the violet dwarf star at galactic coordinates 167.84, -58.03, mark 948.
	Mr. Wong	Already approved, you cackling hens. So get out, or I'll have vice-president Agnew's headless body throw you out.
	Leela	I'd like to see him try.
	Richard Nixon	Me, too. Should look funny. Sic 'em, Agnew.
	Richard Nixon	Runaway golf cart!
	Leela	Look out, Agnew!
	Richard Nixon	Whoa!
	Mr. Wong	Aah!
	Leela	Is... is he okay?
	Mr. Wong	No pulse.
	Richard Nixon	They killed the headless remains of Agnew. Arrest them!
	Frida	All Feministas she-vacuate the premises. I mean "femises."
	Richard Nixon	My fellow Earthicans, these eco-crooks will face the maximum sentence. For killing a headless torso, that's six weeks.
	Bender	Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on for years about killing all humans, and who actually does something about it? Some chick.
	Fry	Leela's not a killer, and she's not some chick. She's the chick I love. And don't tell her I called her a chick, or she'll kill me.
	Frida	Everyone stay absolutely quiet!
	Feminista	That thing's on. Shh!
	Feminista	Turn it off!
	Frida	Oh, sorry.
	Frida	How do you turn it off?
	Frida	There. Did that do it?
	OTHERS	No. Stop it. Shut up.
	Frida	Here's the button here. [An alarm starts wailing from the megaphone.] (Through megaphone): And I think I... Now I got it.
	Leela	Let me give you a hand.
	Frida	This is awful. I never meant for our protest to have any effect.
	Trixie	Maybe we should just surrender and serve our six weeks in jail.
	Dixie	Hey, yeah! We could do each other's toenails and make shivs.
	Leela	That's crazy. We've done nothing wrong, other than killing and dismembering the vice-president. We need to make a choice, sisters. We can either keep pestering criminals like Leo Wong with silly slogans...
	ALL	Yeah. Let's do that.
	Leela	Actually, I meant that to be the less preferable alternative. We can either chant slogans or we can take action.
	Dixie	What was the first choice again?
	Leela	I choose to save the environment by sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course. Who's with me?
	Frida	Could we still use our bullhorns?
	Leela	Absolutely. Bullhorns are a core principle of eco-feminism.
	Frida	Then I'm in.
	Leela	Who's ready to kick some sweaty man-butt?
	Dixie	I've got my pointy man-kicking shoes on.
	Trixie	Those are cute.
	Dixie	Aren't they? I got them at Nine West.
	Leela	Simmer down, warriors. Full power to the vagyroscope!
	Mr. Wong	Those dirty rings. I tried soaking them out, even blasting them out.
	Frida	Are you sure about this? It would be better for propaganda if we weren't using refined sugar.
	Leela	It's okay. The potato we're shoving in the tailpipe is organic.
	Mr. Wong	I smell sabotage. [He sniffs.] Ooh, and potatoes.
	Leela	Now, unfortunately, the media is going to put a negative spin on this, like when we killed that guy, so to win public support, we'll need a lovable mascot.
	Zoidberg	 :[He picks it up and laughs.] Squirm all you want, you nasty dumpling. One less species for the universe, one more breakfast for...
	Leela	Zoidberg?
	Zoidberg	Leela. Me saving things the leech. Not the eating of it.
	Leela	Zoidberg, I'm very surprised at you, slightly.
	Fry	Psst! Leela.
	Leela	Shh! I'm a fugitive.
	Fry	I know. I miss you so much, Leela, even more than when you were here.
	Leela	I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something I really care about...
	Fry	You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you. That's all I need to know.
	Leela	Goodbye, sweet goofbag.
	Bender	 :[He sighs.] I'll miss her, too, buddy. Dibs on her iPod.
	Zoidberg	Dibs on her- ohh...
	Hutch Waterfall	Hey, Fry! Long time, man.
	Fry	Hey, Hutch! What have you been up to?
	Hutch Waterfall	Same old, same old. Searching the dumpsters, protecting my thoughts with tin foil, peeing myself.
	Fry	So, what brings you to Earth?
	Hutch Waterfall	It's top secret. Hey, take off your helmet and I'll think it to you.
	Fry	Okay. Here goes.
	Fry	Where are you? And me?
	Hutch Waterfall	The Great Hall of the Ancient Legion of Madfellows. Welcome, bro.
	ALL	Welcome, bro.
	Hutch Waterfall	Sorry I bashed your head in, buddy, but I had to. You see, the fate of the universe depends on you.
	Fry	Yeah, I get that a lot.
	Hutch Waterfall	The Grand Curator will tell you more.
	Fry	Take me to him.
	Nine	Hey, man.
	Fry	Hey.
	Nine	So dig this, Fry. Our commune has been monitoring the universe's life energy for, like, a really long time, and we're grokking some super weird junk.
	Fry	Um, I don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of hard to take you seriously when you say junk like "grok" and "junk."
	Nine	 : What about "commune"?
	Fry	Especially "commune." Come on, it's the fate of the universe, puff it up a little. Like you could say your ancient order is sensing deep upheaval in the cosmic life energy field.
	Nine	Okay. I'll try. So, like, a really, really long time ago... [Fry motions "longer" with his hands.] Eons ago! [Fry gives a thumbs up and he giggles.] Cool. Eons ago, the life force we call Chee permeated the universe. [He presses a button and a hologram is shown in the room.] The Green Chee generated a great upwelling of life across the cosmos. But then, for reasons unknown...
	Fry	Ooh. "Reasons unknown." Now that's the sort of hook that grabs the attention of me, the viewer.
	Nine	For reasons unknown...
	Fry	Nice.
	Nine	...the Chee began to recede, and the diversity of life began to wither. The life forms we know today are but a fraction of a fraction of the magnificence that once existed.
	Hutch Waterfall	But a bunch of dudes, right, they totally passed this far-out knowledge down through the ages.
	Nine	Some with this knowledge were called prophets, some, fruitcakes. We, the Legion of Madfellows, are their heirs.
	Fry	Hey, I'm on TV. [He waves.]
	Nine	Well, that's the show. [He turns off the hologram.]
	Fry	Neat. What's it got to do with me?
	Nine	Ahh, pooperdoodle! I mean, pardon the omission. You see, after untold eternities, we have sensed a resurgence in the Chee.
	Fry	Hey, that's the violet dwarf star that Leela wants to save.
	Hutch Waterfall	Freaking nailed it, corndog.
	Nine	We believe this star heralds a new green age, and it's your destiny to be its shepherd and protector.
	Fry	Me? Why?
	Hutch Waterfall	'Cause you got, like, no delta brainwave, man. The Dark Ones can't groove off your thoughts.
	Nine	Silence, Hutch! For now, let's just say we have enemies, enemies who can read minds, except yours. [He points with his foot.]
	Fry	Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela.
	Nine	No! If you tell anyone, then their thoughts could be read. For the sake of those you love, you must keep this secret. Do you foot-swear?
	Fry	Oh, okay. I foot-swear.
	Nine	Good. Now, to save the coming of the green age, you must stop this man.
	Fry	I know him. Leo Wong. I work with his daughter.
	Nine	Oh, good, that will cut about 15 minutes of explanation. You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf.
	Mr. Wong	Looking for a job, eh?
	Fry	Yes, sir. Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at the bottom and infiltrate my way up.
	Fry	I'm good at keeping nutcases.
	Mr. Wong	I said no way. (Telepathically): This idiot don't look like he could handle those feministas.
	Fry	I look like an idiot who can handle those feministas.
	Mr Wong	He'll have to do better than that.
	Fry	I'll have to do better than that.
	Mr. Wong	Hmm. You and I think a lot alike. You really think you can stand up to those eco-freakos?
	Fry	Sir, with me around, they'll be the least of your worries.
	Tester	Stand by, men. And manly aliens. Prepare to test fire King Kong hole.
	Sal	It workses.
	Tester	Good job, men. And manly aliens. Construction of King Kong hole complete.
	Frida	Typical. Always King Kong, never Queen... Quong.
	Sal	What are those, hooks? Get out of heres, you hookers.
	Sal	[He's flying through space.] Helpses!
	Leela	You go, gorilla !
	Morbo	Our top story. The string of eco-vandalism that began with a harmless vice-presidential killing has spread across the galaxy.
	Linda	Why do you always get to read the top story, Morbo?
	Morbo	Because viewers trust a deep male voice and huge, throbbing forehead veins. [They pulse in unison a few times.]
	Linda	Not all reaction to the crime spree has been negative. We spoke with several people who viewed these courageous eco-feminists as heroes.
	Petunia	I just wish there was some way to... Excuse me. [She coughs roughly.] Some way to show I support 'em. Send them some smokes or something.
	Linda	This just in: Root 2 News has received a video communique from the eco-feminists' unknown hideout.
	Leela	This is sub-commander L., with a message for Leo Wong. Leo, you're a parasite on the universe, and parasites must be destroyed. That's why we've adopted this parasite as our mascot. [The leech snarls against the glass of its case.] I know it's a little confusing. The point is, even this vicious leech has a right to exist. And that's why a vicious leech like Leo Wong must be exterminated. [The Feministas in the background cheer.] Again, confusing. Feministas unite! [They pound their breasts twice and throw their fists into the air while reciting that last bit.]
	Morbo	In other news- [Linda throws her high heel at his head and it becomes lodged in his head.]
	Linda	Feministas unite!
	Linda	Feministas unite! [The image is paused.]
	Richard Nixon	Incredible. Absolutely incredible. You're telling me this TiVo machine can pause and rewind live TV?
	Mr. Wong	These crazy broads gonna ruin me, Nixon. You gotta help me. Send the army or something. Something big that shoots.
	Richard Nixon	Sir, I don't care if you are my biggest contributor. Our armed forces do not serve your private business interests.
	Mr. Wong	Sorry, I...
	Richard Nixon	[He laughs hysterically.] I'm just yanking your chain, Leo. I'm on it like boring on Gerry Ford.
	Zapp	Zapp Brannigan purporting for duty. For the love of God, Kif, less piccolo, more fife.
	Richard Nixon	Report, Brannigan.
	Zapp	Mr. President, I failed to identify these curvaceous banditas despite hours of staring at their dossiers. [There is a picture of Leela from behind on the cover of the file folder.] Yet, I seemed to have stroked myself upon good luck, for a patriot of the highest order has volunteered to lead us to them.
	Bender	Hey-oh!
