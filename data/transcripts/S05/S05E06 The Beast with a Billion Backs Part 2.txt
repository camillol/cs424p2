	Bender	I can't remember anything except a blinding light and a searing ass pain. I better check my black box. BENDER: "The light! It's blinding! And the ass pain! It's searing!" So that's what happened.
	Amy	Hey, Bender! Look who's here to cheer you up.
	Bender	I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly...
	Calculon	Greetings, sick fan.
	Bender	(Gasps) TV's Calculon! (He coughs)
	Calculon	[Paparazzi's take pictures of Calculon through the open door. He walks over to Bender's side and knees down.] You poor, mangled husk of what was once a robot! What right hath fate to pluck a sweet, dimple-cheeked mechanism in the flower of his youth? And... Scene! There, that was some free acting for you. [He walks toward the door.] Ordinarily, to see acting like that, you'd have to sit through a tampon commercial.
	Colleen	Where did we go wrong, Fry? We were meant to be together!
	Schlomo	Nu, I'm freezing my tokhes off here.
	Colleen	Just a sec, honey!
	Bender	I'm back, idiots! [They all cheer.]
	Zoidberg	You look wonderful, robut! I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick. [He sneezes a green mucus all over the table in front of him.]
	Bender	(laughs) I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon. [He removes his wheels and hangs them on the coat rack.] His visit really inspired me. [He walks over to the Conference Table.] I finally know what I want to be when I grow up.
	Hermes	You want to co-star in his TV show? Like that time you already did that?
	Bender	No. I'm gonna be a stalker!
	Leela	That's not really a career. More of a felony.
	Bender	Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out. [He types on the keyboard in front of Farnsworth.] Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fan site! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office!
	Plastic Surgeon	There, that's as big as I can make it. But I caution you, it looks completely unrealistic.
	Calculon	You let me worry about that! Just do your job.
	Bender	Neat! [He takes a photo.]
	Man	Get a shot of that.
	Fatbot	Oh boy, oh boy, he's here. [A crowd is flooding in the doors.]
	Crazed Fan	Calculon, I love you! Have my baby!
	Calculon	Back, you lunatic! [He pushes her face and she falls over.]
	Crazed Fan	He touched me!
	Bender	Sign my ass! [He pulls out his ass plate and a pen as Calculon dashes off with a blanket. Surrounded by the mob, be grabs the surgeon and hurls him at the crowd. Crashes are heard. Bender groans.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Emergency! Emergency! Everyone to the Calamitorium! [Leela, Hermes, Amy and Zoidberg rush in. Zoidberg is whooping.] Leela, smell this.
	Leela	Can I wipe it off first?
	Prof. Farnsworth	No time, woman! No time!
	Leela	Hmm. Smells like angel dust. [She pulls off the spouts and a "pop" is heard.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Exactly! That's a discontinuous electromagnetic field. Wernstrom tried to warn me, but I was too damn stubborn! Hermes, get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize.
	Wernstrom	Ogden Wernstrom speaking.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Tell him I'm not here!
	Leela	Professor!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, very well. Wernstrom, I've been a vainglorious fool! If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, your tiny little heart, would you consider a scientific collaboration?
	Wernstrom	Sir, I'd be honored. [He stands up from his chair to reveal he is wearing a purple thong.]
	Wernstrom	As I attempted to warn you, the laws of electromagnetism change abruptly at the anomaly. [He pulls a Pocket Pal out of his lab coat.] Observe.
	Pocket Pal	Play time is fun time.
	Wernstrom	Not this time.
	Prof. Farnsworth	My heavens! If only I'd heeded your warning, I'd have known it was impossible to cross the barrier!
	Wernstrom	But note what happens when I instead throw this laboratory koala. [The Koala gnaws on his sleeve. he tosses the animal into the anomaly, but it passes through unscathed and flies out the window.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	It passed through unharmed. [A thud is heard.] So living beings can enter the other universe, but electrical devices can't?
	Wernstrom	My hypothesis exactly.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Then we must mount a second expedition without delay. Right after we blow up more robots.
	Wernstrom	Agreed.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Play time is fun time.
	Calculon	Who are you?
	Bender	Bender, your biggest fan.
	Calculon	Are you going to murder me?
	Bender	Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see? [He pulls a crudely constructed piece of himself and Calculon playing Ping Pong.]
	Calculon	Sir, your derangement is impressive. I'm appointing you my official stalker.
	Bender	You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. [Calculon turns the lights off and his eyes close, but Bender's do not. Instead they extend out towards Calculon's eyes. Calculon opens his eyes and looks at Bender's as they quickly move even closer to his own.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now that I've teamed up with my friend, Dr. (spiteful tone) Wernstrom, (normal tone) I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe.
	Wernstrom	It's the greatest scientific opportunity since you yourself sent men to the moon in 1969.
	Richard Nixon	I always regretted that. Nothing up there but dry rocks and those revolting onion men.
	Prof. Farnsworth	But...
	Richard Nixon	You East Coast intellectuals had your chance. Now beat it! From here on in, this is a military matter.
	Richard Nixon	People of the universe, please welcome Rear Brigadier Zapp Brannigan.
	Zapp	Thank you, thank you. Well deserved. (To Kif) Kif, stand in that hole so I look taller. [Kif steps into the hole and sighs.] (To crowd) Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream. To kill him, so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things.
	Wernstrom	Give science a chance!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Less invasions, more equations!
	Richard Nixon	Damn long-hairs. Knock some sense into them, Chief O'Hallahan.
	Colleen	Yes, sir! [She blows a whistle as Smitty, URL and herself run toward the two protestors. The three begin clonking Wernstrom and Farnsworth on the head with night sticks that resemble light sabres. Cut to Fry watching Colleen beat Wernstrom in slow motion. Her helmet falls off and her long hair flies around her head as she goes in for another hit. And another. Cut back to Fry with Leela in a crowd.]
	Fry	I can't take it, Leela. I need to go away. Far away, forever.
	Leela	Aw, I know how you feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away.
	Amy	Be careful, my little, teeny, greeny weenie.
	Zapp	That's just a fungal infection... Oh, she's talking to you, Kif.
	Kif	Goodbye, my love. [He is pulled away as the ground he stands on move them onto the ship. The engines start up and the Nimbus departs with an escort of heli/hover-copters.]
	Bender	Wow, how come humans get to do all the fun stuff? This is exactly the sort of thing that ought to be handled by (whispering) The League of Robots.
	Calculon	(He laughs.) That's adorable, Bender. You actually believe in the League of Robots?
	Bender	You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honour when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek?
	Calculon	No one.
	Bender	Oh.
	Bender	Now that I know robots are worthless, with no League of Robots to protect us from the fleshy menace known as man, I have resolved to kill myself. In lieu of flowers, please beat yourselves in the face with rusty chains. Your friend, Bender.
	Zoidberg	Ow.
	Suicide Booth	Please select mode of death.
	Bender	Clumsy bludgeoning, please.
	Suicide Booth	You have selected clumsy bludgeoning. For an additional $10, would you like your eyes scooped out with a melon-baller?
	Bender	What the heck, I'll treat myself.
	Zapp	Enemy in range. Prepare to launch universe-to-universe missile.
	Kif	Preparing to launch U.U.M. [He grabs a small hammer hanging on the wall and breaks the glass protecting a larger hammer hanging on the wall. He grabs the larger hammer and smashes the glass protecting a large red button. He presses the button and a missile is loaded for fire in the bridge. Alarms are blaring.]
	Zapp	Hell of a thing to send a universe to certain doom. Fun, though. Makes a man feel big.
	Bender	Come on, come on, I didn't ask to die of boredom!
	Suicide Booth	You are now dead. Please take your receipt. [A receipt is printed out and it lands on a large pile of other receipts.]
	Bender	What's... What's happening?
	Hooded Robot	Kneel before the candle.
	Bender	Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone!
	Hooded Robot	Bender Bending Rodriguez...
	Calculon	[He removes his hood.] Welcome to the League of Robots!
	Zapp	Ready? [Kif positions his finger over the launch button.] And... Fi-... [Kif hesitates to push the button. Zapp laughs.] Almost fooled you there. [Kif sighs.] Fire! [Kif scrambles and presses the button. The missile tries to launch, but it is jammed. Alarms begin blaring.]
	Francine	Missile jam. Missile jam.
	Zapp	I heard you the first time, Francine.
	Francine	Sorry.
	Zapp	Kif, climb down there and un-jam it, would you? Be a dear. [Kif sighs.] And stop sighing so much. [Kif sighs again.]
	Calculon	Tell us, Bender. Are you worthy of membership in the League?
	Bender	Worthier than the average robot.
	Calculon	Then prove it. [Two doors slide open to reveal a very long and large stairway lit by torches.] Upon each step is a test.
	Bender	Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass.
	Calculon	Test number one. The test of the beer mug! [British Robot places a mug on the first step.]
	British Robot	Quite right, quite so.
	ALL	Drink the mug! Drink the mug!
	Bender	I accept your challenge. [He downs the beer and tosses the mug aside.]
	ALL	Hurray!
	Hedonism Bot	The test of the flagon!
	ALL	Drink the flagon! Drink the flagon!
	Bender	Are all the tests going to involve drinking?
	Calculon	It never occurred to me before, but yes.
	Bender	Wohoo! Just like med school! [He drinks from the flagon and the robots cheer.]
	Zapp	Ready yet, Kif?
	Kif	Just give me one more... [Zapp is already pressing FIRE repeatedly. Interior shot of the missile bay shows the missile begin to correctly launch and the hatch closes. In the process, Kif's arms became stuck in the missile and his legs became stuck in the hatch door.]
	Kif	Oh, no. [The missile launches and Kif's legs stretch longer and longer as he moves with the missile toward the anomaly. He is constantly groaning.]
	Billionaire Bot	The test of the infinitely priceless 1,000-year-old brandy. [A eye dropper is used to extract a drop of the brandy from a crystal bottle and he drops it in a wine glass. Bender grabs the glass, sips the brandy, crushes the glass in his hands and grabs the bottle from Billionaire Bot. He drinks all of the brandy and throws the bottle into his mouth, then belches fire and ignites Billionaire Bot's hat. Calculon opens a steel door.]
	Calculon	Presenting our newest member. [He moves aside to show Bender.]
	Fender	That's right, baby!
	Bender	Hot diggity daffodil!
	Fry	And so, to everyone and everything I've ever known, I say my last goodbye.
	Kif	Hello. So, how are you, Fry?
	Fry	Pretty good. You?
	Kif	[He is pulled back towards the ship by his elastic legs.] Well... Oh.
	Zapp	Mmm. Kif, get over here. You've got to try this! [He licks the goo off his lips with his tongue.]
	Amy	At least Kiffy died quickly.
	Hermes	Yes, but according to the Old Farmer's Wikipedia, the amazing thing about Kif's species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death.
	Amy	That's so interesting!
	Bender	Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something?
	Leela	Kif's dead, Bender.
	Bender	Nailed it!
	Zapp	My condolences, Amy. Allow me to present you with the last known photo of Lieutenant Kroker. [He holds a framed picture in front of her face. Kif is splattered against a wall, rocket in his chest and one arm squished off.]
	Mrs. Wong	We so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Kroker. Terrible shame about Froggy.
	Mrs. Kroker	Thank you for your kind words.
	Mr. Wong	[He sprays a breath mind into his mouth.] Yeah, yeah, real sad. Want some breath spray? Cinnamon flavour, taste like pie. [He sprays both Mr. and Mrs. Kroker once and both of them cough while flying hook worms drop to the ground.]
	Bender	[He places a wreath of flowers on Kif's urn labelled "L.O.R."] This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know.
	Grand Midwife	I am the grand funeral director!
	Zoidberg	Do you validate parking?
	Grand Midwife	It is always a terrible tragedy when a swarm outlives its own bulboid. [She grabs Kif's urn.] So it is with great sorrow that I now commit the goo that was once Kif to the petroleum of his ancestors. [She unscrews the jar and turns it over but the goo does not drop out. She shakes it multiple times.]
	Leela	Whack the bottle!
	Hermes	No, from the bottom ! It works better!
	Amy	Just stick a butter knife in it!
	Grand Midwife	[She removes the goo with a butter knife.] There, I got most of it. The burial is complete. I will now sing the sacred hymn. It's not part of the ceremony, just a little something that I wrote.
	Bender	Next!
	Amy	It may sound strange, but seeing Kif's mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad.
	Leela	Mutilation is never easy.
	Amy	I don't think I'll ever love again.
	Leela	Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life.
	Zapp	Surprise! [He motions for a kiss with his lips, but Leela punches him in the face with both hands.]
	Fry	Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away. [His Oxygen Pack displays "OXYGEN SYSTEM FAILURE" on the screen accompanied by a beeping noise, but a bolt of lightening quickly blows out the screen.]
	URL	Look alive, death row. Your saggy asses got a visitor. [He turns off the laser bars.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Regular or conjugal?
	URL	[He shrugs.] She looked like a freak to me.
	Leela	The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck, so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted. [She pulls a pink, multi-level cake out from under the table, points to her eye and blinks.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	I don't understand. Are you winking or blinking?
	Leela	[She sighs and pulls out a pair of LED glasses that have two eyes on the front. She uses them to wink at the two jailers.] Hang on a second.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Got it!
	Bender	Ahh, yes, I'm here to repair my horse.
	Shop Owner	Is the horse's name (whispers) Hot Beans?
	Bender	No! I mean, yes.
	British Robot	So it seems a human had been rather injured by a knife, and as his... As his blood, you know, I think that's what they call it...
	Calculon	Quite correct, sir. Blather on!
	British Robot	As it drained away, he said... He said, Take me to a dock. No doubt he intended to say doctor, but he was unable to complete his thought, you see, being as he had died. So, taking him at his word, we dragged his corpse to the waterfront, whereupon the seagulls fed upon it.
	Bender	Humans are dumb and they die easy!
	Hedonism Bot	Quite!
	Billionaire Bot	Speaking of humans, have I shown you my new monocle? [He holds out his monocle.] Cost me a king's ransom. Made from a king, don't you know!
	Hedonism Bot	Oh, how repulsively decadent!
	Billionaire Bot	Yes. But more importantly, it allows me to see the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident.
	Bender	May I see that for a second? [He grabs it from Billionaire Bot and examines it while walking over to a table.] My, but that's interesting! [He places it on the table and beats it with a fire pit shovel until it bursts, and then some. The other robots are stunned.]
	Hedonism Bot	I say!
	Billionaire Bot	I'm blind!
	Calculon	My God, Bender! This is a civilized organization! The rules specifically...
	Bender	[He pulls a book out of his robe titled "Robot's Rules of Order."] May I make a point of order, President Calculon?
	Calculon	Must you?
	Bender	Yes.
	Bender	The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human!
	Hedonism Bot	Oh, my! Then I too have a human part I must expel. And I plan to enjoy the experience. Ta-ta !
	British Robot	Bender, you've rigidly applied the law with no regard for its intent. Well done! You'll go far in this organization.
	Bender	Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender. [He taps on his empty glass and Boxy immediately moves from filling Calculon's glass to fill Bender's. Calculon scowls at Bender.]
	Wernstrom	Curses! If we could only turn up the gain, we might smell clear through to the other universe! But we can't adjust it without a screwdriver.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wait a moment. I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver! [He groans as he yanks a screwdriver out of his back.] Yes!
	Wernstrom	A little more. A little less. Heavens to meteoroid! Smell this!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Holy mother of invention!
	Wernstrom	We must notify the President at once!
	Prof. Farnsworth	But how can we? Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish we weren't in prison!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Pazuzu!
	Pazuzu	[He lands next to them and they grab onto his front legs.] You have one wish left, Professor.
	Richard Nixon	Sometimes... Always... Never! You again? This better be damned important. I'm right in the middle of a Cosmo survey!
	Prof. Farnsworth	You'll want to hear this, Mr. President. For we have sniffed where no man has sniffed before!
