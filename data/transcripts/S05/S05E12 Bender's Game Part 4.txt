	Mom	Previously, on Futurama. [she slaps the camera]
	Fry	Bender, I think you might be [visuals cut to Bender running around with a sword, wearing a pot on his head] playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
	Bender	I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
	Younger Mom	A new super fuel, eh?
	Mom	If the crystals get within six inches of each other... [She slaps Larry.] Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.
	Mom	Give me the anti-backwards crystal.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Never! [He eats the crystal and begins to chuckle. The crystal glows in his stomach, along with the keys to the ship. The ground cracks open and everybody falls into the hole with the ice.]
	Frydo	What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?
	Leegola	I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror.
	Zoidberg	I'm not the Tunneling Horror.
	Leegola	No, no more killing.
	Zoidberg	Oh! So, suddenly, Miss Goody Four-shoes over here doesn't kill anymore. She killed me not five minutes ago. What am I? Chopped liver?
	Leegola	Shut up. [She slashes into his chest.]
	Leegola	You're on your own. (Sobbing:) I refuse to hurt another living thing. [She throws her sword behind her and it decapitates Zoidberg. She then gallops out of the cave. Frydo turns to look at Titanius Anglesmith getting thrashed around against the walls.]
	Titanius Anglesmith	Any time now.
	Frydo	The Die of Power. I forgot to remember to roll it.
	Die of Power	Three.
	Frydo	"Grow?" I don't see anything growing. Everything is getting smaller. [Frydo rips through his clothes and shoes as he grows in size then hits his head on the ceiling of the cave.] Ow. Wait a second. I'm big! In your face, everyone from middle school especially Jeremy. [He grabs the Tunneling Horror and begins punching it in the back, eventually punching a hole right through it. When he pulls his fist out air escapes from the creature and it shrinks down to the size of a normal bug and scampers to a hold in the wall. Frydo then shrinks back to normal size while laughing, his pitch matches his size.] Wow, that was intense. You guys got to try the Die of Power.
	Titanius Anglesmith	I'll take a hit.
	Frydo	Hands off the dodecalicious. [He snarls at Titanius Anglesmith and protects the die.]
	Greyfarn	We must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came.
	Momon	I send you to kill them and they're not even maimed? That's what I get for sending boys to do a mom's job.
	Larius	Sorry, Mom.
	Momon	Sorry doesn't put heads on my table. Peaches. [An ogre comes out of a tunnel.] You're up.
	Ignus	I like this part but I don't like...
	Centaur Opponent	You are an able opponent, Hermaphrodite. But hear me well when I posit that we must abhor violence in all its forms.
	Hermaphrodite	I offer a dissenting opinion.
	ALL	[A gasp-like "huh?"]
	Leegola	I'm not here to hurt you. Or anything ever again. Please, teach me the centaurs' ways of wimpiness.
	Hermaphrodite	What do you offer in return?
	Titanius Anglesmith	Yes! We made it out of that godforsaken cave. Now, what's the fastest way home? Back through the cave? [Greyfarn hits him in the head with his staff.] Ow! [His eye shield falls from its mounted position.] Ow!
	Greyfarn	We're close now, my friends. So close, I can practically feel the heat of the fiery molten plastic.
	Gynecaladriel	You're standing in the fire.
	Greyfarn	Oh, my. [He yelps and walks out of the fire.] Alas, our path is blocked by Momon's army of evil. As well as her navy of moral dubiousness.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Mayhaps we might raise an army of our own. We're but an hour's ride from Wipe Castle.
	Greyfarn	Of course. Wipe Castle. And while we're there, we can get some of those greasy little dwarf burgers.
	Gynecaladriel	Ooh! I love those. You can eat like eight of them without gaining any weight because of all the diarrhea.
	Greyfarn	Sleep deep, fair snoozles. At dawn, we ride for Wipe Castle. [Frydo howls in front of the moon.] Quiet, Frydo. [He howls again, but softer.]
	Waltazar	Right away, Mother. I'll just leave a small contingent behind in case...
	Momon	I said, everything. Peaches!
	Peaches	(offscreen): I'm in the tub.
	Momon	Waltazar, you and Larius shall lead the assault.
	Waltazar	What about Ignus?
	Momon	I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Ignus I've never told anyone. And here it is.
	Momon	It's a good day to be evil. [She begins laughing, followed by Waltazar and Larius. Peaches joins in too.] Oh, put a towel on, for crap's sake. [She slaps him.]
	Reflection Host	Tell you what, you want to defend a magic artifact, and I mean, defend it good, then what you need is a top-quality knife.
	Frydo	Me is listening.
	Reflection Host	The Eviscerator is one of the finest, if not the finest, tactical folder on the market today. We're talking 440 stainless, quick release and... I don't believe this. Is this a stag horn handle at this price?
	Reflection Host 2	It is, yeah. It's a stag horn.
	Reflection Host	At this price? You have got to be kidding me. That's got to be some kind of mistake, right there.
	Reflection Host 2	Now, you folks at home, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, that can't be stag horn. It's got to be the cheaper manticore horn. But, I've got the specs right here and I'll tell you what, this is the real deal.
	Reflection Host	Unbelievable.
	Reflection Host 2	It is unbelievable. That's exactly what it is. I mean, this is... I have no words to describe this deal. Honestly, have you ever seen stag horn at this price?
	Reflection Host	No, no, I don't believe I ever have.
	Reflection Host 2	1101-1816 is the item number on this one.
	Reflection Host	You know what, we're gonna have to put a clock on this deal, folks. Two minutes. Can I get a clock at two minutes up there?
	Reflection Host 2	Two minutes at most. Honestly, I'd be surprised if they last that long.
	Reflection Host	Oh, I'd be very surprised, shocked really. Now, I know the lines are busy, people, but keep dialing in if you want a truly exceptional knife to slice up your friends in their sleep.
	Titanius Anglesmith	He tried to murder me. He tried... Woah, cool. Is that the stag horn?
	Greyfarn	Alas, Frydo's weakness was no match for the die's strength. We can only hope he forges on alone to the Geysers.
	Titanius Anglesmith	I can hope my ass is made of ice-cream but that don't make me a hot fudge sundae.
	Greyfarn	As for us, we must press on to Wipe Castle, though the journey be long and I fear I may not live to see it.
	Gynecaladriel	There it is!
	Frydo	They's following us's.
	Zoidberg Head	You know, you talk like that, it's gonna cost you points at a job interview.
	Frydo	What does it wants?
	Zoidberg Head	I thought I could help you destroy the die, maybe.
	Frydo	(In his normal voice:) Yes, yes, please help me. The die is tearing me apart. (In his raspy voice:) No, it's not. We're having a nice time. (In his normal voice:) Shut up. (In his raspy voice:) You shut up. (In his normal voice:) S'all right? (In his raspy voice:) Who's a s'all right? (In his normal voice:) Help me!
	URL	Now, before your audience with the king, there's a shocking fact you best know about him.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Enough blabbety-blab! Open the doors.
	Roberto	What, ho?
	Titanius Anglesmith	We bring ill tidings, o fanciest of men. Momon's reach nears the die of power. And should she obtain it, she will then have the entire basic set. Rivers will run red with blood and yellow with urine. And a dog will be seen eating cat food in the land. Oh, great king, your army is the last hope of Cornwood. Let us join forces before the light of good is extinguished forever.
	Roberto	You calling me crazy? Just 'cause I've got a hotel in my foot don't make me a boogalee-moogalee-moogalee.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Pardon?
	Roberto	Stop laughing at me, fried avocado.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Moving along then. As the only nobleman present who's not... [He crosses his eyes and makes crazy noises.] ...I hereby place myself in command of the royal army.
	URL	What royal army would that be?
	Greyfarn	What?
	Smitty	King went insane and declared war on the scallops. Tied his army to a boulder and pushed them into the sea. They never returned.
	URL	Scallops must've got them. [Smitty nods.]
	Titanius Anglesmith	Methinks we be boned.
	Larius	Where's their army?
	Waltazar	Maybe they didn't hear the horn. Blow it again. [He blows his horn.]
	Roberto	[Running around through the ogres. He stops one of them.] What the... You're not made of Tuesday. [The ogre strikes Roberto over the head with his club.] My sanity. It's back. At last, I can live the life I always... [The ogre strikes him again.] AHH! Boogalee-moogalee-moogalee!
	Man	Ow! [Another arrow is then shot.]
	Female Centaur	Evil will soon triumph over good.
	Hermaphrodite	Your friends face certain death. Followed by a disrespectful marionette show performed with their corpses.
	Leegola	No! We've got to do something.
	Hermaphrodite	Believe me, we will. We've taken out a sternly worded ad in tomorrow's Cornwood Times. [He holds up a news paper with the headline "There must be a better way" printed on it above a picture of an ogre being beheaded. Leegola kicks through the paper and everybody gasps.]
	Hermaphrodite	Well, Leegola, if you have a better idea, perhaps you'd like to challenge me to debate.
	Frydo	I'm too exhausted. I can't go on.
	Zoidberg Head	I'm here for you, my friend. Grab onto my testicles.
	Frydo	You know, I think maybe I can walk after all.
	Momon	(From the die) That's not Wipe Castle.
	Zoidberg Head	What are you waiting for, Frydo? Throw it already in the boiling plastic.
	Frydo	I would. But... (In raspy voice:) Me's enjoys owning it.
	Zoidberg Head	Stop talking like that. It gives me anxiety. [He launches himself at Frydo and bites his tushie.]
	Momon	No!
	Die of Power	Twelve.
	Frydo	So, it's all come down to this. A dungeon and dragons.
	Zoidberg Head	I didn't see it coming.
	Ogres	Eat the wizard, eat the slut. Eat the robot's shiny butt
	Gynecaladriel	Well, at least we'll be remembered in song.
	Titanius Anglesmith	Wait a second. I have an idea. I surrender. Here, eat my friends. Just give me one more second of sweet, sweet life. [As the ogres stop, thousands of arrows strike them and all the ogres fall. Titanius is still holding up his two companions. He clears his throat.] Well, that worked out pretty good, eh, fellows?
	Leegola	Prepare to fire again, brave cowards.
	Hermaphrodite	I still say, I won the debate. [Leegola strikes him in the stomach with a piece of wood.]
	Ogre	Wuh-woah.
	Remaining Ogre	Whew!
	Gynecaladriel	Leegola, you saved us. How can I ever repay you? [She kisses Leegola, but it quickly turns into passionate kisses. A large eruption of the geysers breaks the kiss and they all gasp.]
	Titanius Anglesmith	[While watching Leegola and Gynecaladriel kiss.] Can it wait a couple of minutes?
	Greyfarn	Yes. Yes, it can.
	Frydo	You are no match for my dragon style. [Momon breathes fire and Frydo ducks, but the fire burns his wings off.] I guess you are a match for my dragon style.
	Momon	Tell me, Frydo, are you aware that a dragon's one weakness is its soft underbelly?
	Frydo	No. Why do you... [She leaps and bites his belly. Frydo screams in pain.]
	Titanius Anglesmith	It is all over, Momon. We'll soon be down there defeating you. And it's all thanks to the existence of this fragile staircase. [He laughs victoriously, then Momon stomps on the ground, causing the staircases on either side of them to disintegrate.] Whoa!
	Ignus	Quick. Get on the magic bug.
	Greyfarn	It's not a magic bug, you dope. It's a magic arachnid. Can't you count the legs?
	Ignus	No.
	Greyfarn	Six, seven, eight. Not six, eight. I'll kill you, you imbecile.
	Momon	My underbelly. My one weakness.
	Zoidberg Head	[He picks up the die.] I got it. Now I can throw it in the hot thing over there and be the hero. On the other hand, infinite power might be nice.
	Ignus	Please, I'm trying to help you.
	Greyfarn	Then why are you hitting me with a stick? How stupid are you that you think that's helping?
	Ignus	Mommy never told you about my father.
	Greyfarn	She said he was a foul He-demon.
	Ignus	Exactly. [He clicks off his lightsabre device.] You are my father.
	Greyfarn	No. No, that's impossible.
	Ignus	Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
	Greyfarn	No! [He hits his head with his staff.] No! [He hits his head with the staff again.]
	Zoidberg Head	[While jumping and spinning between Frydo and Momon.] I have all the dice. I am the dungeon master. I know all and see... [He is squished by the falling Greyfarn. The die rolls away from him and Momon quickly snatches it up.]
	Mom	What happened?
	Leela	My God, we're out of that weird, crazy world and back in our regular crazy world.
	Fry	Did we all just have some kind of freaky dream or was it ghosts?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Neither, Fry. It was science. Bender's mighty imagination amplified by a dark matter resonance created an alternate reality that very nearly blew our minds.
	Hermes	Exactly. You can't make that kind of stuff up.
	Mom	Quit trying to explain everything. I defeated you in that world and I'll defeat you in this one. Boys, the crystal’s still in his stomach.
	Walt	Commencing intestinal flash flood.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wait! Before my moment of shame, can I...
	Mom	Yes, speak up.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Can I give my boy a hug?
	Mom	All right. Fine. I've never done it. I guess somebody should.
	Inger	Daddy. [They hug.]
	Igner	We both eated the crysals. [They giggle together.]
	Mom	My dark matter. It's worthless.
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's right, Mom. But fear not, fancy folk for I've just thunk up an alternative energy source. Nibbler-power.
	Nibbler	Hurray. Wait. What?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Mush! Mush! [He whips the Nibblonians.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Faster, [Whip] faster. [Whip] Slower. [Whip]
	Garry Gygax	Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
