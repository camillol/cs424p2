	Hermes	Planet Express delivery company roll call! Captain Turanga Leela!
	Leela	Here!
	Hermes	Delivery boy, first class, Philip J. Fry!
	Fry	Here!
	Hermes	Assistant Manager of Sales, Bender Bending Rodriguez!
	Bender	Here! [Falls on Fry and Leela from above] Cerveza, por favor.
	Hermes	Long-term intern, Amy Wong.
	Amy	Here!
	Hermes	Company physician, Dr. John A. Zoidberg.
	Zoidberg	Huh? I thought it was mine!
	Hermes	Bureaucrat Grade 34, Hermes Conrad
	Hermes	Is who I am. And now I am proud to present the owner and founder of Planet Express, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth!
	Prof. Farnsworth	You're all fired.
	Hermes	Sweet bongo of the Congo!
	Prof. Farnsworth	In fact, you were fired two years ago! That's when we were shut down by the delivery network.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, I'm afraid the brainless drones who run the network canceled our license.
	Fry	We were canceled?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, it's terrible. Just terrible. Well, clear out your desks and move along. Chop-chop.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes? I see.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! Those asinine morons who cancelled us were themselves fired for incompetence.
	Staff	Woohoo!
	Prof. Farnsworth	And not just fired, but beaten up, too. And pretty badly.
	Staff	Woo!
	Prof. Farnsworth	In fact, most of them died from their injuries.
	Staff	Woo? [Bender laughs]
	Prof. Farnsworth	And then they were ground up into a fine pink powder.
	Fry	Why?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, it's got a million and one uses.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ahhh, that soothes the fire.
	Leela	So what does this mean for us and our many fans?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It means we're back on the air!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, flying on the air in our mighty spaceship!
	Staff	Woooohoooo!
	Bender	We're back, baby!
	ALL	Party! Go, go, go!
	Cubert	Lower, lawn mower!
	Hermes	What's the matter, robot? You got a rod up your spine?
	Bender	Yes, I do. That's how I'm built.
	ALL	Hooray.
	Fry	Way to bend it!
	Bender	You're the greatest, Bender!
	Hermes	In Jamaica, we got 10-story office buildings lower than that.
	Leela	Let's see you beat it, Rastaman.
	Staff	Ooooohh...
	Hermes	Let's make it interesting. Fetch down one of them sabres.
	Bender	Oh, flexible. That would go good up my spine.
	Hermes	Lower.
	Bender	The fat guy wins!
	Fry	Go, Hermes!
	Hermes	That's why they call me 11-inch Conrad.
	Scruffy	Oh, no.
	Fry	Can you save Hermes, Dr. Goodensexy?
	Dr. Cahill	I told you, my name is Dr. Cahill.
	Hermes	Figures I'd get mangled while the blonde bimbo's on duty.
	Dr. Cahill	I'm a doctor, sir. The mere fact that I'm blonde and have a breathy voice, full sensual lips, and a steaming hot body doesn't make me a bimbo.
	Zoidberg	Tell me about it.
	Hermes	I think we've all learned a thing or two about sexual stereotypes. While my head's slowly dying 'cause I'm not in a jar yet, you bimbo!
	Dr. Cahill	Oh, right. Ditzy-witzy! Lars, got another jar job!
	Lars	Oh, sorry, Doctor. I was disinfecting Courtney Love... Oh, hello.
	Leela	What are you looking at? Is it the eye?
	Lars	Guilty as charged. It's a nice looking eye, and there's plenty of it.
	Leela	Oh. Do I know you?
	Lars	Apparently not. Hi. I'm Lars.
	Leela	Oh. I'm Leela. Nice to meet you.
	Lars	Nice to be met.
	Hermes	Pick up ladies on your own time, you shiny-headed goat!
	Lars	Sir, you're just a little enraged 'cause you're dying. Up and away!
	Amy	Lars is so flirting with you.
	Leela	He is so not. He's just being polite.
	Fry	Who does he think he is, being polite to you? You want me to beat him up?
	Leela	No. Stop being so immature.
	Fry	I'll show her who's immature.
	Fry	"Charles de Gaulle"? Never heard of you.
	De Gaulle	I freed France from the Nazis and...
	Fry	Hey, Leela. I'm some French guy.
	Bender	Rock that Frenchman, baby!
	LaBarbara	Oh, my poor little love pirate of the Caribbean!
	Hermes	There, there, wife. Everything will be all--
	LaBarbara	Okay, look, Hermes, we got to think of the boy. He needs a daddy.
	Hermes	He has a daddy!
	LaBarbara	No, he got two half-daddies. Will his body be all right?
	Dr. Cahill	Yes, but it may take a few days.
	LaBarbara	No, not soon enough. Come, Dwight, let's find you a handsome new father.
	Hermes	LaBarbara, no!
	Bender	It's okay, Hermes. We're all here for you.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! We've got a delivery to the nude beach planet.
	Staff	Woohoo!
	Bender	So long, jerk.
	Leela	It feels great to be back at the wheel after two long years.
	Fry	That's not the wheel.
	Leela	It's nice out.
	Fry	"You must be at least this naked"? How much nakeder could you be?
	Zoidberg	Watch and learn.
	Bender	You know, it's funny.
	Fry	What?
	Bender	Your weiner!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, I'm going in the water to prune up a bit before I strut. Who's with me?
	Amy	I'm in!
	Leela	I'm in.
	Bender	Yeah, I'll go.
	Fry	You guys go ahead. I gotta find the bartender and deliver this box of barstool softener.
	Fry	Here's your package, sir.
	Bartender	Why are you talking to my penis?
	Fry	Oh, sorry. Sign here.
	Bartender	Mind if I use your pen?
	Fry	Well, that's not a...
	Fry	And initial here. [screams again OC]
	Fry	Thank you for using Planet Express.
	Leela	Hey, Fry, I didn't know you had a tattoo of Bender on your ass.
	Fry	Me neither.
	Bender	You got a tattoo of me? Neat. It's like looking in a smelly mirror.
	Prof. Farnsworth	So he's got a little ink. Big whoop.
	Bender	Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth.
	Nudar	Sir, would you care to sign our petition?
	Bender	I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen.
	Nudar	That's just what the guys who oppose the things you support want you to do.
	Bender	Really? Down with those guys!
	Fleb	And we'll need your e-mail address.
	Bender	Hmm, they say you shouldn't give out your e-mail address.
	Nudar	Right. That's just what those same guys say.
	Bender	Them again?
	Leela	I don't quite understand what this petition's about.
	Schlump	: Animals?
	Schlump	: And your e-mail address.
	Leela	You won't send me any spam, will you?
	Nudar	Oh, no, no, no, no. Asterisk.
	Leela's Wrist Thingy	You've got spam.
	Leela	Spam, spam, junk.
	Amy	Spam. Spam. "Hi. How are you?" Oh, that must be from Kiffy.
	Amy's computer	Hi, how are you? Low, low prices on erectile dysfunction remedies, sleeping pills, old-person drugs, and antidepressants.
	Amy	Antidepressants? Well, I certainly don't want to get depressed.
	Amy's computer	Please enter credit card number.
	Amy	Is cash okay?
	Bender	Porn. Porn. Free porn. Get rich watching porn? I find that rather hard to believe.
	Bender	Warning, perform virus scan? I'm waiting for porn over here.
	Bender	Oh, yeah, come on, baby.
	Zoidberg	Friends, friends! His Majesty Prince Adisaraki O. Zoidberg of Nigeria died.
	Amy	When will those antidepressants get here?
	Zoidberg	Wait, there's more. Once I wire some good-faith money to an overseas bank account, I'll inherit his kingdom, his canoe, and his plump young wife.
	Hermes	You dumb stumps. Don't you realize you're being scammed?
	Zoidberg	That is low, Hermes. Just because you don't have a body, you don't want anyone else to be prince of Nigeria. Well, try and stop me from wiring that money.
	Prof. Farnsworth	What's going on here? According to my illegal key logging software, you've all been giving out personal information over the Internet. If Hermes were here, he'd fire you all.
	Hermes	I am here!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Quiet, you. In his absence, I'm calling a mandatory company security seminar. To the mandatorium!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now, it's not hard to spot a phoney Internet come-on. "Get rich quick x7 q"? Phoney. "Lose weight with space parasites"? Phoney. What's this? I've won the Spanish National Lottery?
	Leela	No, it's a scam!
	Prof. Farnsworth	My goodness, I'm rich! And to think I didn't even know I had a ticket. I just need to wire some collateral to collect the winnings.
	Hermes	Professor, stop! You're giving away personal information!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I can afford to give away anything I want. I've won the Spanish National Lottery.
	Amy	No, don't!
	Leela	It's a scam!
	Hermes	Why won't anybody listen to me?!?
	Prof. Farnsworth	And my mother's maiden name and her bank account numbers and ... There! I'm rich. Rich. Rich!
	Prof. Farnsworth	That must be my $400 now. Hello. Or should I say, '"Buenos dias"?
	Nudar	Hi. We own your company now.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hwhaa?
	Bender	Welcome, boss.
	Nudar	Guess I was wrong. There was a robot stupid enough to download the obedience virus.
	Bender	I sure was. Make a hole, chumps. [Bender gets a red carpet out of his cavity and imitates a trumpet fanfare] Presenting our new masters!
	Bender	Where shall I put these auto-dialers, kind master?
	Nudar	Between the password crank and the spamjaculator. Come on! We've got a whole planet to scam. And bring me some more Gummi Fungus!
	Leela	We don't have to stand here and take abuse from a gross nerd.
	Amy	Yeah!
	Fry	Yeah!
	Leela	Hi-yah!
	Nudar	Now get back to work, you turkeys. Planet Express is still in business. We've got crap loads of quote-unquote merchandise to deliver.
	Fleb	Ship them out, Your Highness.
	Zoidberg	Finally, some respect.
	Amy	I feel a little better.
	Bender	Those marvellous scammers sure scammed us, huh?
	Leela	How can you just sit there kissing the aliens' butt flaps? Don't you realize you are totally under their control?
	Bender	Of course I realize it. Does that mean I can't enjoy it? Boy, were we suckers.
	Lars	Greetings, earthlings.
	Fry	Oh, hooray. It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars.
	Lars	Hello, everyone who isn't Leela. And a special hello to everyone else.
	Hermes	Shut your lockers and get to class. How's my body doing?
	Lars	Oh, I'm afraid it's behind schedule. The museum got tricked into giving all its funding to something called the Scamming Sciences Institute.
	Bender	It's a fake place.
	Hermes	No! That body's the cornerstone of my marriage. What's LaBarbara going to do?
	Amy	Spluh! She's going to go back to her first husband.
	Zoidberg	Barbados Slim? I love that guy.
	Hermes	Everybody loves Slim.
	Hermes	He's the only man to ever win Olympic gold medals in both limbo and sex.
	Lars	Well, maybe I should get going.
	Fry	Yes, I'll show you out.
	Amy	No, Leela will show him out.
	Leela	No, Leela will show you out. Me. Leela.
	Lars	So your friend, Fry, seems nice. Are you and he dati--?
	Leela	Nope.
	Lars	Good, because I was maybe thinking of asking you out for dinner.
	Leela	Ohhhh. I'll start maybe thinking about saying "Sure, when?"
	Lars	Let me maybe give it some thought.
	Lars	Tomorrow at 8:00?
	Leela	Okay.
	Fry	It's not fair. I've loved Leela since the day I came to the future. Did I show you the macaroni valentine I made for her?
	Amy	Yes.
	Fry	Look at it again. I know she thinks I'm immature, but someday I won't be. And deep down in my heart, I know we'll end up together. It's all there in the macaroni.
	Leela	Lars asked me out!
	Bender	What are you doing, wonderful masters?
	Fleb	Sprunjing for information.
	Nudar	Oh! There's something here. I can sprunje it. Robot, tear it open!
	Bender	Goody, goody, goody, goody!
	Zoidberg	What's that thing on your neck?
	Nudar	Checking out my sprunjer, huh?
	Zoidberg	I guess. What does it do?
	Nudar	It's a special sense organ our species possesses. It engorges in the presence of... [moans] Information.
	Zoidberg	Lucky you. All I have is a gland that gives off foul odors when I'm bored.
	Bender	Hey, look, a safe!
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's my safe. I call keep-offsies.
	Nudar	No callsies! Open it!
	Fleb	It's a gold mine. Tax forms, Social Security cards. Combination hair, blood and stool samples!
	Fry	I don't get it. How can you say Lars is more mature than me?
	Leela	Well, for one thing, his chequebook doesn't have the Hulk on it.
	Nudar	Who are you?
	Fry	Philip J. Fry.
	Fleb	Social Security Number 03280810? Stool type, P-negative?
	Fry	That's right.
	Nudar	I've never detected so much information before. I think it may be a Level 87 code.
	Schumlp	Level 87? Can it be? I thought it was only a legend, but the sprunjer never lies.
	Nudar	It's in his pants!
	Fry	What the hell are you talking about?
	Nudar	Faster, faster!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm sciencing as fast as I can.
	Bender	What do you say, folks? Hot or not?
	Nudar	You, boogerbot, read the code or I'll shoot this guy.
	Bender	Who the hell is he?
	Scruffy	I'm Scruffy, the janitor.
	Bender	Hang on, Scruffy! Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one.
	Fleb	A time sphere.
	Nudar	Naked brothers, we have sprunjed upon the universal machine language time code. The key to time travel!
	Leela	What's the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass?
	Fry	It was bound to be somewhere.
	Schlump	Beyond this shimmering portal lie all the glories of history.
	Nudar	And we can steal them! We just go to the past and take stuff with our superior weapons!
	Nibbler	Stop, you fools!
	Amy	What's going on?
	Prof. Farnsworth	What is happening?
	Leela	Nibbler, you... You can talk?
	Nibbler	I can do more than talk. I can pontificate. You must not use the code of codes. With each and every use, you risk tearing the universe asunder.
	Schlump	The poodle-monkey may be right. The legend warns that the code is powerful and dangerous.
	Nudar	My God. We'd better use it only three or four times. Six, max.
	Nibbler	But even a single use could shatter the universe!
	Nudar	Got it. Two or three times.
	Nibbler	I see I have no choice. Nibblonians, attack!
	Nudar	And the pitch!
	Nibblonian	Mayday, mayday!
	Aliens	Hey! Hey! Hey!
	Nibblonian	Scamper!
	Zoidberg	Aawww...
	Nibbler	Alas, our kitten-class attack ships were no match for their mighty chairs. The universe is doomed. Doomed!
	Fry	Can I pull up my pants now?
	Nibbler	Dooooooomed!
