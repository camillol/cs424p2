	Narrator	Previously on Futurama.
	Morbo	It has now been one month since space ripped open like flimsy human skin. Terrified earthlings are beginning to grow exhausted.
	Hermes	Professor, sprinkle us with wisdom from your mighty brain. How scared should we be?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Somewhere between not at all and entirely.
	Zoidberg	I call entirely. [He springs up, flipping the table upside down and knocking food and beverages all over the four on the couch. He whoops and scuttles his way out of the room.]
	Morbo	Scientists believe the rip is a gateway to another universe, but do not know what mysteries lie beyond. However, in this reporter's opinion gruesome death awaits us all!
	Linda	And now with sports, here's Sportsbot 5000.
	Sportsbot 5000	All sports cancelled.
	Prof. Farnsworth	To better understand the anomaly, I will now focus its radiation on a giant medium-sized ant to see what happens.
	Giant Medium-Sized Ant	What's going on here? I was told there would be sugar syrup.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Quiet, you. [He pulls a switch down. A giant magnifying glass focuses a beam of light from the anomaly onto Farnsworth's head. His forehead to the tip of his upper lip is blasted by fire. Farnsworth screams and Leela sighs and flips the switch to "off." She pulls out a fire extinguisher and puts out the Professor's head.]
	Fry	Oh, hey, everyone, this is Colleen.
	ALL	Hello!
	Amy	I like your shoes.
	Bender	This is awkward. Introducing your new girlfriend to Chesty McNag-nag.
	Leela	Oh, don't mind him. I'II turn him off.
	Bender	Hey, you can't (voice slowing)turn me off...
	Leela	Hi. I'm Leela.
	Colleen	Hi, Leela, hi, everyone. Sorry I've been taking up so much of Fry's time. He's just so interesting. Have you seen how much cotton candy he can eat?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, my, yes. 5.1 pounds. That's why his blood is so good on pancakes. [He picks up a stack of pancakes with Fry's blood acting as a syrup.]
	Fry	Well, got to skedoodle-oodle. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village. [The two kiss, then exit the room.]
	Zoidberg	This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs.
	Leela	It is pretty sickening.
	Zoidberg	No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met.
	Zoidberg	So, how did you and Colleen first meet?
	Fry	Well...
	Fry	Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real.
	Colleen	It's so scary. What are you supposed to do when the whole universe is coming to an end?
	Fry	I have a thought. [Cut to the two of them in bed, both smiling. Fry blows a bubble with his gum and it pops around his mouth.]
	Bender	This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man!
	Amy	Speaking of sappy love... Want to tell them, Kiffy?
	Kif	Yes, Amy and I have a big announcement. I... That is, we... Oh, I'm just so excited.
	Amy	Kif has asked me to be his Fonfon Ru. [She hugs Kif.]
	Zoidberg	Mazel tov!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wonderful!
	Hermes	What the hell does that mean?
	Kif	It means I've asked Amy to join my family. And you're all invited to my family swamp for our Fonfon Rubok ceremony.
	Amy	If I had ever heard of it, it would have been what I had always dreamed of.
	Kif	Oh! And our parents will be meeting for the first time ever.
	Bender	[He gasps.] That's even more awkward than Fry's two bimbos meeting each other. Count me in. [Leela turns Bender off again. He falls to the floor in a static pose.]
	Kif	Mr. And Mrs. Wong, aren't you excited that we're all about to be joined in a single family?
	Mr. Wong	You can't borrow money.
	Mrs. Wong	Kif's parents come late and we have to stand around in swamp getting eaten alive by damn bugs? [She squashes a bug on her neck
	Kif	Mrs. Wong, no. The finial stage of my species' life cycle is a colony of flying hookworms. You just squashed part of my father.
	Mr. Kroker	Welcome.
	Mrs. Wong	Sorry. I guess you got plenty of bugs to spare though, huh?
	Mr. Kroker	That was my left testicle.
	Bender	[Outside of the conversation] And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding, ding, ding, ding ding...
	Fry	Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas.
	Colleen	Thanks. This is really fun. I love going to exotic worlds and getting hammered.
	Fry	Me, too.
	Bartender	Two more Harvey Wallclimbers. [He drops a frog in each, the beverage begins to react with it and overflow.]
	Zapp	Leela, I can't help but notice you're unescorted. Might I escort you behind that bush for the next five minutes?
	Leela	Nothing would revolt me more.
	Zapp	Then how about that shrub?
	Kif	Ooh! Rubok is begun.
	Grand Midwife	I am the Grand Priestess.
	Fry	Aren't you also the Grand Midwife?
	Grand Midwife	And the grand Lunch Lady. I work five jobs, all grand. Kif of the clan Kroker, please transcend the Rubok Etlon with your Fonfon Smizmar Ru.
	Kif	What?
	Grand Midwife	Get in the mud. This mud is the petroleum from a billion generations of Kif's ancestors. [She swirls her staff around in the mud and pushes on Amy's and Kif's forehead, leaving a mark of mud.] As you become one with the ooze, so you become one with the clan Kroker.
	Amy	Oh, Kif, it's like a movie with this happening in it.
	Grand Midwife	Is the best man present?
	Zapp	Guilty as charged.
	Grand Midwife	Kindly hose the couple.
	Grand Midwife	[Holding up a snake.] As it was, so it is. You may now eat the snake. [The two grab, then take a bite of the snake.] If you so choose. [They both spit it out.] It's not part of the ceremony. I just had an extra snake. Rubok is complete. Throw the bouquet.
	Zoidberg	Are you going to eat that? [He devours the bouquet in Colleen's hands.]
	Bender	[From the living room couch] Fry, run, run. Get over here, oh, my God, oh, my God!
	Fry	What? What is it?
	Bender	Shut up already! Calculon's on TV!
	Monique	I beg you, Calculon, don't ring that door chime.
	Calculon	I have no choice, Monique. Whoever the blackmailer is, he lives behind this hideous yet strangely familiar door.
	Human Friend	Calculon residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Calculon.
	Calculon	Son of a bit. This is my house. But that means I'm blackmailing myself. Why didn't you tell me, Monique?
	Monique	I tried to, but I couldnâ€™t. Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about, and it and I are lovers!
	Bender	How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry?
	Fry	[Adjusting his tie in the mirror] Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run.
	Bender	But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right?
	Ride Barter	Step right up to the 2D Tunnel of Love. Not one, not three, but two glorious dimensions for the price of a single ticket. [Fry and Colleen are sitting in a ride car.] Keep your hands in the car, shut up, and have fun.
	Fry	Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D.
	Colleen	I do? But from your perspective, I'm just a line segment. [Shot of Colleen as a line segment.]
	Fry	A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step.
	Colleen	Really?
	Fry	Yes. Colleen...will you be moved in with by me?
	Colleen	(SOFT GASP)
	Amy	Way to go.
	Zoidberg	Hooray, hooray.
	Leela	That's great.
	Bender	You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us? [He curls into a ball at Fry's feet.] I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. (WHIMPERING)
	Prof. Farnsworth	Listen up, everyone. I know you've all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly.
	Hermes	The what? Oh, right.
	Prof. Farnsworth	But there's good news! We're all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference.
	Man walking on screen	...like a city made of marshmallow.
	Stephen Hawking	Welcome. I am the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a way-cool rocket.
	Leela	Black hole Hawking? Wow, if I knew I was going to meet you I would have done something with my hair. [She plays with her hair.]
	Stephen Hawking	You should have.
	Stephen Hawking	In conclusion, I understand nothing about the anomaly, even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I know this anomaly is terrifying. But as scientists, is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge, even at the cost of our very lives?
	Stephen Hawking	No.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith.
	Wernstrom	I agree.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wernstrom!
	Wernstrom	Professor Farnsworth is correct. Only a manned mission can... [Yelps as he is hit on the head with a pair of dentures.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Don't listen to that crackpot!
	Wernstrom	But I'm agreeing with you.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'll make you eat those words, you moron! [He spits his dentures into his hand and prepares to throw them, but Hermes and Leela stop him from doing so.]
	Wernstrom	Ah! [Protects himself with his arms.] I volunteer to lead the expedition. I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Your squad sucks bosons! My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable.
	The PE Crew	Yeah!
	Wernstrom	Oh, tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal.
	Crowd	Ooh!
	Stephen Hawking	Ooh!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wernstrom, I ought to...
	Stephen Hawking	I didn't know I could do that. Now quiet down and settle this like men of science.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Very well.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Let Deathball begin!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Go, Planet Express!
	Wernstrom	Go even more, my team!
	Fry	Leela, header! [He prepares to knock it over to Leela, but it easily tramples over him. Cut to Bender smoking a cigar. A ball hits him, but he doesn't move. It bounces off him then hits a wall and rolls into a hole. The hole lights up blue. Cut to the scoreboard: "1-1." Cut to Fry riding on top of a ball. He manoeuvres it around a hole and heads toward an opponent riding another ball.]
	Colleen	Woo hoo! Bust those balls!
	Zoidberg	Hooray! We're equally good! [He is run over from behind by a ball.]
	Leela	Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that!
	Bender	No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.
	Bender	And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end.
	Colleen	Come here, winner!
	Colleen	Come here, loser! [She kisses him.]
	Fry	Colleen, what are you doing? My face is over here.
	Colleen	This is my boyfriend, silly!
	Fry	I thought I was your boyfriend.
	Colleen	You are.
	Fry	Well, how can you have two boyfriends?
	Colleen	Oh, I don't. I have five. [Three more men walk in and stand next to Chu.] Fry, meet Chu, Bolt, Ndulu, and Shlomo.
	Chu	Nihow.
	Ndulu	Greetings.
	Bolt	Pleasure.
	Fry	But... But...
	Colleen	Shlomo and Ndulu will help you move your stuff into my apartment tonight.
	Ndulu	Welcome to the relationship, buddy!
	Fry	Hmm? [He spits a piece of butterscotch into his hand.]
	Chu	There's my butterscotch.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Congratulations, Deathballers! We've won the right to explore the anomaly!
	Zoidberg	What? I thought I was playing for my freedom!
	Prof. Farnsworth	No. [He inserts a crank and turns it to power a hologram of the Anomaly.] Now, I've often said "good news" when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is.
	Hermes	Not dangerous at all?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Actually, quite dangerous indeed.
	Hermes	That is quite dangerous!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying! Prep the ship and line up for your pre-flight coffee enemas!
	Fry	I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends?
	Leela	What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters?
	Fry	No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator.
	Zoidberg	Take the deal, Fry! If there's a delicious cake, isn't it better to have one slice than none at all? Even if four other guys eat the other four slices, and they're all thrusting their sweaty naked bodies against the cake?
	Amy	Only one thing matters, Fry. Do you really love Colleen, like I love my little squeezle? [She squeezes him and his head expands and eyes expand out of his head. He giggles.
	Fry	Yeah. I do love her.
	Kif	Then things will work out. [Amy lets go of him and he contracts to normal size, but one eye remains out. Amy pokes it and it pops back to normal size.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Whoa!
	Enema Bot	Double espresso for Philip Fry?
	Fry	Sorry, I'm not going on the mission. I'm moving in with Colleen!
	Kif	Good for you, Fry.
	Zoidberg	Hooray!
	Amy	Alright!
	Fry	I'll just take that to go. [He is poured a coffee and it's handed to him.]
	Colleen	Yay! [She hugs Fry.] Welcome to your new home!
	Fry	Thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before. [They walk through the doors.] I'm just happy to be here with you.
	Ndulu	Want a slice of delicious cake?
	Bender	(Gasps) The anomaly!
	Amy	It's so anomalous.
	Hermes	I'm feeling dread deep in my dreads!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wernstrom!
	Wernstrom	Yes, and I'm afraid I have disturbing news about the anomaly. You see...
	Prof. Farnsworth	How did you get this number? Hermes, hang up on him in the rudest possible manner.
	Hermes	Yes, sir! [He drops his pants and grasps the phone between his buttocks.]
	Wernstrom	No, not the crack slam! [Hermes slams the phone down and the screen goes to static.]
	Colleen	Oh, my life rocks. [She pours the wine into six glasses.] I've got good wine, five sweethearts, and today, I was promoted to Chief of Police.
	Fry	Here's to you.
	Chu	Me?
	Fry	No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast.
	Chu	Sorry.
	Fry	You have the most beautiful eyes I think I...
	Ndulu	Thank you.
	Fry	I'm not talking to you!
	Ndulu	Then I am not talking to you, either.
	Schlomo	Will everyone be quiet a little? I want to hear what he has to say!
	Fry	Thank you.
	Schlomo	Not you, you Verstinkener. You're just here 'cause she likes cave men from the stupid ages.
	Bolt	Oh, look who's talking. You're just here 'cause she got matzoh fever.
	Ndulu	So, what's the explanation for you, moron fever? (laughs)
	Colleen	Enough! All of you! I love you. Most people in this world don't have what we have. Let's just be grateful, okay?
	ALL	Yeah.
	Chu	Yeah, you're right.
	Fry	So, Colleen, you look really nice.
	Colleen	Oh, thanks. I got dressed up for my date. [A car horn honks. Colleen runs toward the door.] There he is. Don't wait up!
	Fry	That's it. I thought I was okay with this, but I'm not. I'm breaking up with you! [Musical score is played. Colleen looks as Fry sadly and he retains his anger.]
	Ndulu	Me?
	Bender	Why are we risking our lives? Can't we just send in a robotic drone? [He looks over at the crew, who are expectedly staring back at him.] What's everybody looking at me for?
	Bender	"Let's send a robot to explore it. 'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks."
	Leela	Really?
	Bender	Well, it's 30 bucks, and there's a $10-mail-in rebate. When the League of Robots hears about this, they won't be pleased. Oh, you'll pay, my darlings.
	Hermes	The League of Robots doesn't exist, tin mon. It's just a cartoon for babies.
	Bender	Oh, yeah? Then how come when I was a kid, I had a whole sticker book of them? [She airlock doors shut and Bender's voice is muffled.] Answer that with your precious logic.
	Bender	Bender to crew. I have reached the gateway to another universe. I feel awed and strangely humbled by the momentous solemnity of this occasion. (yelling) Hey, other universe, bite my shiny metal... [He thrusts his ass into the anomaly, but he and the ship are shot away from it by a pink blast. Everybody is screaming and bricks fall out of Bender.]
