	Fry	Previously, on Futurama.
	Hutch Waterfall	Truth is, you're a mind reader.
	Fry	Oh, my God!
	Leela	Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve... [She pets the leech, it makes a noise and then it bites and clamps onto her neck.]
	Nine	You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf. [during this line images of Fry talking to Wong and of the violet dwarf are seen.]
	Hutch Waterfall	The fate of the universe depends on you.
	Fry	Yeah, I get that a lot.
	Leela	It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
	Fry	Except in Kansas.
	Mr. Wong	I smell sabotage.
	Leela	Feministas unite! [They pound their breasts twice and throw their fists into the air while reciting that last bit.]
	Leela	Not so fast, Brannigan. [All nine of the feministas have guns.]
	Bender	Even less fast, feministas! [He has a gun that controls nine other guns.]
	Bailiff	Oye, oye, oye. All rise for the honorable Chief Justice D-O-G-G and the Associate Justices.
	Snoop Dogg	Yo. Seat it or beat it. The charges against y'all femditos is murder, mayhem, vandalism, kidnapping and resisting arrest. Damn! The big five. You may now make your opening "what you got to say for yourselves."
	Leela	May it please the Court... [Judge Dogg slams his gavel.] I mean, may it plizzle the cozizzle.
	Dogg	Proceed.
	Leela	These charges are outrageous. Our only goal was to save a rare violet star and its precious ecosystem. If protecting the environment is a crime, then...
	Judge Dogg	Protecting the environment is a crime.
	Leela	[She clears her throat.] I rest my mouth.
	Bailiff	Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
	Richard Nixon	I... Well, now, I... Am I under oath when I take the oath?
	Ruth Bader Ginsburg	Can the witness identify the feminista leader?
	Bender	That's her right there, with the "I'm gonna kill you Bender" look in her eye.
	Antonin Scalia	Hey, aren't you the robot who robbed me at gunpoint last year?
	Bender	No further answers, Your Honor.
	Fry	Please, Justice Dogg, Leela and her friends are completely innocent.
	Dogg	Hold up. Were you or were you not abducted by these hoes?
	Fry	Well, abducted is such an ugly word.
	Clarence Thomas' head	Mr. Wong, the court cannot compel you to testify against your own daughter.
	Mr. Wong	No. No, I want to. Also, I got something to say about my wife.
	Dogg	Aw, yeah. Having heard some of the testimony over these jams I've been listening to, me and my crew will now kick it in the mix.
	Dogg	A'ight. We got us a verdict up in this High Court. Bailiff, drop it like it's legal precedent.
	Bailiff	In the matter of Leo Wong v. The Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, four justices vote to convict, five to acquit.
	Scalia	However, since the vote was strictly along gender lines and the female justices' votes only count half, you are hereby found guilty.
	Ginsburg	It's a humiliating and biased system, but it works.
	Dogg	Fifty years in the maximum security Dogg house. [He bangs his gavel.]
	Warden	Ladies! Welcome to hell.
	Petunia	Beats Nutley on a Saturday night.
	Warden	This is a privately-owned for-profit prison and I run a tight, cheap ship! I've done this by cutting cost everywhere, especially on punishment. I rely on you inmates to make prison unpleasant for yourselves. You're encouraged to sexually harass new prisoners, organize no-holds-barred catfights and maintain poor hygiene.
	Amy	Try and make me, copper.
	Warden	Oh... a troublemaker. [She laughs.] Taste the lash of my 99-cent-store nightstick!
	Mr. Wong	Yee-ha! With the feministas in jail, it full speed ahead. You and me, Fry. We implode the violet dwarf star tomorrow. Ka-boom-boom.
	Fry	You and me?
	Mr. Wong	Yeah.
	Fry	Tomorrow?
	Mr. Wong	Tomorrow.
	Fry	Ka-boom?
	Mr. Wong	Ka-boom-boom.
	Fry	Hello? Madfellows? I need to- [He is hit on the head with a bottle and passes out. Small time lapse and he awakens.] Okay, Leo Wong's about to destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know to stop him, tell me now.
	Nine	Alas! Stopping Wong isn't the only problem. One of the Dark Ones will try to stop you from stopping him. So, you must stop it from stopping you from stopping him.
	Fry	But how can I stop it stop me stop him?
	Nine	Stop it! Behold, the Omega Device.
	Fry	That's it?
	Nine	The important thing is what's inside.
	Fry	What does that look like?
	Hutch Waterfall	No one knows, man. It was invented by a blind inventor, and the one dude he described it to was deaf.
	Mad Fellow	So the legend goes.
	Nine	When activated, the device will emit a localized blast of delta-band noise to momentarily disable the Dark One.
	Fry	But the Dark One could look like anything or anyone, right?
	Hutch Waterfall	Or anywhere.
	Fry	So, what's your plan to recognize it?
	Nine	We don't have one.
	Fry	Got it.
	Hutch Waterfall	And we don't dare think of one neither. 'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones might sense kind of the general vibe. Even through our mighty foil. [He pokes a hole through his hat.] Oh, man! Anyone got some tape or some gum?
	Nine	As my colleague indicated, the plan cannot come from us, Fry. We were counting on you and your unreadable brain to come up with something.
	Fry	That was a mistake.
	Nine	I see that now.
	Hutch Waterfall	Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones' thoughts are unreadable, just like yours.
	Nine	Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads, we could easily locate the one other being whose mind we can't read. The Dark One!
	Hutch Waterfall	But then the Dark One would read our minds and crush them like blood pumpkins.
	Fry	Wait. I can read minds and my mind can't be read. I have a plan.
	Nine	Great. Whatever it is, don't tell us.
	Hutch Waterfall	Wait. Fry can read minds and his mind can't be read. So he can safely scan for the Dark One...
	Nine	Shut up! Shut up!
	Hutch Waterfall	...whose mind can't be read...
	Mysterious Voice	Leela, time is running out. We must get to the violet star.
	Leela	Okay, okay. Shut up, already.
	Dixie	Nobody's talking, Leela.
	Trixie	We're just painting each other's toenails with rat blood.
	Linda	We now go live to Leela with the escape plan. Leela?
	Leela	Thanks, Linda. Now we're in here because we tried to save endangered wildlife. So this time, endangered wildlife will save us.
	Amy	The Martian muck leech.
	Leela	[She gets light headed and has to sit down on a bed.] Little cutie almost sucked me dry.
	LaBarbara	Look at him go. Like a green snake through a sugarcane cake.
	Hermes	Keep trying.
	Morbo	Our top story. The universe's most wanted eco-feminists are now behind bars, including gang leader, Turanga Leela. AKA, the Notorious B-I-Itch.
	Zoidberg	We finished un-pinking the ship, Hubert. Now what?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now we get back to work. And if that means destroying an ecosystem or two, so be it.
	Zoidberg	I just meant without our good friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robut.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, boo-hoo.
	Scruffy	Life goes on. But I believe we'll forever carry the pain on the inside.
	Amy	Oh, no, a rooster! That indicates it's the following morning.
	LaBarbara	How's that creepy crawler doing?
	Leela	I'm sorry, femi-sisters, but it pooped out around 3:00 a.m. Poor thing couldn't take another bite.
	Amy	Well, I guess we failed. But what matters is, we tried our best and we looked good doing it.
	Amy	Bender?
	Bender	Who does it look like? My identical cousin Buster?
	Amy	Yes.
	Leela	You're here to break us out? But you're the one who put us in.
	Bender	But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Puttin' my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart.
	Leela	You are one devious bastard.
	Bender	That's what it says on my vanity plate. [He bends over and a license plate on his crotch plate reads "1DVS BSTD."]
	Leela	What about the sentries?
	Leela	Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows men have one fatal weakness - they can't resist hookers. Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do.
	Bender	[He walks out with a swagger and speaks in an effeminate voice.] Hello, boys! [The spot lights are directed at him and he is fired at my machine guns. The firing stops.] Your eyes say no, but your machine gun fire says- [The gun fire resumes.]
	Mr. Wong	Ladies and gentleman and whatever, welcome to my most environmentally disastrous implosion ever. A whole star system!
	Zapp	Kif, old boy, mind if I sit on your shoulders for a better view?
	Kif	Well, actually, sir, I was hoping...
	Mr. Wong	My associate Philip Fry here will have honor to blow this ugly, dirty star into nice, clean black hole.
	Mr. Wong	Fry, what you doing down there?
	Fry	[He drops a wire.] Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W.
	Mr. Wong	Mmm, that nice. Get between the toes there, very dirty.
	Bender	Well, so much for Plan B.
	Leela	What's Plan C?
	Bender	All situations have the same Plan C. Bending, come on.
	Leela	We're boned, Bender. It's a brick wall.
	Bender	Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great!
	Amy	Dogs! The boning continues.
	Bender	[He pulls a telephone out of his chest.] Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it.
	Leela	[She enters the bridge.] Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg! [She looks at Scruffy] Uh...
	Scruffy	Scruffy. The janitor.
	Leela	You helped us escape? Even after we locked you in a go-go cage like common go-go dancers?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I couldn't live with myself, Leela. I call myself a scientist, wear the white coat and probe a monkey every now and again, yet I put monetary gain ahead of preserving nature. Can you ever forgive me?
	Scruffy	I reckon.
	Leela	I could kiss you, Professor.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Okay, but watch out for my new grill. [He smiles and shows his gold and diamond teeth.]
	Zapp	Before the grand finally [Mispronunciation of finale] , as it were, it seems only fitting that I, Commodore 64 Zapp Brannigan, say a few brief pages in honor of...
	Nine	Whatever your plan is, Fry, I suggest you get on with it. Get... Shoot, I got hot sauce on my Number 9 shirt.
	Fry	Okay, locate the Dark One by finding someone whose thoughts I can't read.
	Zapp	And unaccustomed...
	Zapp	By God! I'm the greatest speaker of all time. They're suckling at the teats of my every syllable.
	Zapp	Allow me now...
	Kif	His voice is like ear sandpaper.I miss Amy.
	Mom	[She sighs] If I had all the money in the world, I'd... Oh, wait. I do. [Evil laugh.]
	Calculon	I'd like to thank the academy, my agent, and most of all, my operating system, Windows 7, for everything it... System error.
	Snoop Dogg	Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies.
	Mr. Wong	I never should have taken that accent elimination class from Jackie Chan.
	Zapp	And so, as we obliterize this star, let us remember those immortal words once spoken by a great man, moi. And I quote, "All good things must come to an end, preferably in a humongous explosion."
	Mr. Wong	Let's pop this beach ball.
	ALL	Ten! Nine! Eight!
	Fry	There's no one here whose thoughts can't be read. No one, except me! My thoughts can't be read. But, but that's crazy. If I were the Dark One, I'd know it, wouldn't I? But, here I am, right where the Dark One would be, about to blow up the star. Oh, God! Somewhere deep inside of me, it's me! I'm the Dark One!
	ALL	Two... one!
	Leela	Put your hands in the air!
	Snoop Dogg	Should we wave them like we just don't care?
	Leela	That's optional.
	Mr. Wong	You girl punks gone too far this time. Your parents should be ashamed.
	Amy	Yes, you should!
	Kif	Amy!
	Mysterious Voice	Destroy the star, Leo, hurry.
	Mr. Wong	You got it, Mr. Voice-in-my-head. [He makes a howling Kung Fu noise. Him and Leela fight over the plunger. He gets it away from her, but Amy whack him in the stomach with her putter.] I've gotta admit, Amy, you got a pretty good swing.
	Amy	Really? Thanks, Dad.
	Leela	Okay, time to defuse this star cracker once and for all. [She begins to cut the wire for the plunger.]
	Fry	Leela, wait. You're making a mistake. You have no idea what's really going on.
	Leela	What is really going on?
	Fry	I can't tell you.
	Leela	Then why should I trust you? Why?
	Fry	Because... Because...
	Leela	You're you. That's all I need to know.
	Bender	No! Don't do it!
	Scruffy	Fiddlesticks.
	Amy	Leela, are you crazy? We became fugitives and jail-breakers to stop him.
	Bender	And hookers, don't forget hookers.
	Leela	Shame on all of you. After everything we've been through together, do you really think Fry would-
	Fry	Goodbye, Leela. I destroy myself to save you.
	Richard Nixon	Where's the boom? I was expecting a boom.
	Fry	It didn't work. I'm the Dark One, and it didn't do anything. [He throws the plunger to the floor.]
	Mysterious Voice	[It is emitted from Leela's body.] You're not the Dark One, I am.
	Fry	Leela?
	Mysterious Voice	Not Leela, you moron. Me! [It's revealed that the Desert Muck Leech is the Dark One. He screams and falls flat.] What did you do to me?
	Leela	Ew!
	Dark One	I am the Dark One. The very last Dark One. How is it possible I couldn't read your mind? Oh, I am momentarily disabled.
	Randy Munchnik	[He gasps.] What's happening out there?
	Sal	Somethings wondersful.
	Leela	The star and the asteroid. They were an egg and a sperm.
	Preacherbot	Great modem of mercy. Cover the children's eyes.
	Morbo	There are no children here.
	Preacherbot	Then move your fat head. I can't see.
	Nine	The Encyclopod is reborn. A new green age has begun!
	Mad Fellow	So the legend foretold.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Look! Inside its pouch. Extinct Tasmanian tigers.
	Amy	And dodo birds.
	Leela	And white rhinos.
	Hermes	And striped biologist-taunters.
	Striped Biologist-Taunter	What are you gonna do, shoot us?
	Encyclopod	Life! [The crowd gasps.] These once extinct plants and animals are my gift to the universe. Through untold generations, my race has treasured their DNA. Treat them wisely with the knowledge that all species are precious.
	Leela	This is unbelievable. What's going on?
	Hutch Waterfall	To answer that, I must tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that-
	Fry	Hutch, are you okay?
	Hutch Waterfall	My sister's femi-necklace. [He reaches for the necklace lodged in Fry's head.]
	Fry	What? [It is pulled out of his head and he screams.] Hey, how come I can't read your thoughts anymore?
	Encyclopod	I shall avenge you, Hutch Waterfall.
	Nine	After all these eons, the Dark Ones are no more. Will you preserve their DNA, O' Great Encyclopod?
	Encyclopod	I suppose I should. Wait, where did it go?
	Zoidberg	What?
	Encyclopod	Well, at any rate, I shall preserve the DNA of Homo sapiens.
	Fry	Huh. I thought you only saved the DNA of endangered species.
	Encyclopod	Farewell. [He flies away.]
	Fry	I guess he didn't hear me.
	Bender	Well, looks like that wraps everything up in a nice big, old, fat sack of...
	Zapp	I hereby arrest you fugitives on 53 counts of fugivity. Kif, round them up, and spare me the weary sigh for once. [Pause.] Kif?
	Kif	[He is running into the ship with the rest of the crew.] Wait for me.
	Fry	Well, this is the end. There was so many things I wanted to say to you.
	Leela	Like what?
	Fry	Like this is not the end. But mostly just, I love you, Leela.
	wormhole!	Maybe I waited too long to say this, but I love you, too- wormhole!
	Hermes	Sweet topology of cosmology, it's huge!
	Prof. Farnsworth	If we fly into it, it could take us trillions of light years away. There's no knowing if we'll ever return.
	Fry	What do we do? Should we go for it?
	Bender	Into the breach, meatbags. Or not. Whatever. [He starts drinking the beer.]
	ALL	Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
