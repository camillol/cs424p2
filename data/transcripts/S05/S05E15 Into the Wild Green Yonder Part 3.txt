	Leela	Previously, on Futurama.
	Nine	You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf. [during this line images of Fry talking to Wong and of the violet dwarf are seen.]
	Hutch Waterfall	The fate of the universe depends on you.
	Fry	Yeah, I get that a lot.
	Leela	It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
	Fry	Except in Kansas.
	Mr. Wong	I smell sabotage.
	Leela	Feministas unite! [They pound their breasts twice and throw their fists into the air while reciting that last bit.]
	Zapp	A patriot of the highest order has volunteered to lead us to them.
	Bender	Hey-oh!
	Richard Nixon	These eco-feminists are ruthless criminals who'll stop at nothing to save the environment. I don't see how a bending unit can catch them.
	Bender	Not just any bending unit, Presidente. I happen to be brilliant, fearless and short on cash. [He coughs and motions for money with his fingers.]
	Richard Nixon	Slush him, Kroker.
	Zapp	Bender here has identified the femdito commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela, whom I once made love at.
	Richard Nixon	And he's willing to fink her out for a few simoleons?
	Bender	It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet.
	Richard Nixon	That's a despicable motive, Bender, and I respect it.
	Bender	Gracias. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap.
	Richard Nixon	As many as you like.
	Bender	I only need one.
	Richard Nixon	Let's call it six.
	Fry	Hey, Bender, check it out. I'm Leo Wong's new security guard. I got an ID badge and a flashlight, and I ordered this mustache.
	Bender	Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone?
	Fry	Okay, but don't restart my Tetris. I was finally about to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards "L."
	Bender	Okay, superstud.
	Mr. Wong	Looking good, security. No feministas getting past you.
	Fry	No, sir. Not on my mustache's watch.
	Amy	Fry, I can't believe you're working with my dad against Leela. How can you claim to be her friend and still want her in jail?
	Mr. Wong	Don't mind cranky-pants here. She been cranky ever since she was a fat little girl.
	Amy	Dad!
	Mr. Wong	Can I be brutally honest, Fry? I always wanted a son.
	Fry	That hurt, but I can take it.
	Amy	I knew you wanted a son! Why do you think I became a miniature golf champion? Why do you think I wear these stupid boys' sweat suits?
	Mr. Wong	To hide your big, fat butt, that's why. [He giggles.]
	Fry	Now, sir, in fairness, Amy's butt is actually pretty hot.
	Amy	What is it with you men? Why does everything revolve around my butt?
	Mr. Wong	'Cause it's so big and massive. He and Fry share a laugh.]
	Fry	Sorry.
	Amy	That's it!
	Bender	Whoa! What's with Big Butt?
	Mr. Wong	She just hungry.
	Bender	Here you go, Fry.
	Fry	Thanks.
	Bender	Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game.
	Fry	[He looks at the screen on the phone. It reads "GAME OVER."] No!
	Fry	Great! Now Amy's gonna tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain I'm on a secret mission against evil. Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil. [There is a tapping in the darkness. Fry shines his flashlight around.] What's going on in there? A scary noise? [He spots Frida hammering a protest sign into the grass.] Hey, you're one of Leela's feministas. "Save the environment! Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!" That's terrible writing! Stop making your point so ineffectively! [He tries to pull the hammer from Frida's grip.]
	Frida	Take your mands off of me!
	Fry	[He shushes her.] I'm on your side.
	Frida	[She shushes back.] Don't shush me.
	Fry	Please, can you take a message to Leela?
	Frida	[She quickly shushes him.] What is it?
	Fry	Just say her sweet goofbag is working to save the violet dwarf star, just like she is.
	Frida	Very well, I'll fem-municate your man-formation.
	Fry	[He rolls his eyes.] Just tell her.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, this is it, old friends. Planet Express is done for, what with our delivery crew missing and the abysmal sales of Tickle Me Bender.
	Bender Doll	[He doll giggles.] Quit touching my junk, pervert!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hold out your hands and I'll remove your career chips.
	Zoidberg	I hate to see it come to an end. [His chip is removed and he screams in agony.] When will it end?
	Hermes	Shouldn't you get that, Professor?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I suppose. [He walks off screen, but then rushes back to remove the career chip from Hermes' hand.] Hello?
	Mr. Wong	Professor, old buddy, I'm gonna blow up the violet dwarf star. So I need you deliver billion-mile security fence to keep out protesters. Dirty business. Lot of money. You corrupt enough?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Damn skippy! [Money is dispensed from the telephone console.] Good news, crybabies! We're back in business.
	Hermes	Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor. You sure you know how to fly this thing?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I invented it, didn't I? You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison whether he knew how to use a sexmatron.
	Leela	Halt! What are you doing in this parallelogram of space?
	Prof. Farnsworth	We're delivering a fence to keep you ladies in your place. [He chuckles.]
	Zoidberg	Amy?
	Hermes	Labarbara?
	LaBarbara	That's right, husband. From now on, you make your own Manwiches.
	Mrs. Wong	That was the greatest play I ever saw. It must have had 20 acts.
	Leela	We installed your fence, Leo Wong.
	Linda	Should we shout a clever slogan?
	Leela	You mean something like, "The best defense is a good fence?"
	Linda	Yeah, something like that, only funny.
	Leela	I wish we could, but our chief slogan writer is back at the Honeybun Hideout.
	Frida	Does "violet dwarf" rhyme with "men are dorks"? It does through a megaphone. (Telepathically): That reminds me, I've got to tell Leela about that weirdo who wants to save the violet dwarf.
	Mysterious Voice	So, the Legion of Madfellows has a new pawn, eh?
	Frida	Is somebody here? If you're the DSL guy, you're two days late.
	Mysterious Voice	Who gave you that message for Leela?
	Frida	I don't know his name.
	Mysterious Voice	Then you are of no use to the Dark Ones!
	Frida	Long lost brother, avenge my death.
	Fry	Six, seven, eight. Lock the gate. One, two, three. Turn the key. 30, 50, 10. [He sees Hutch.] My dirty, shifty friend?
	Hutch Waterfall	Hey, Fry, long time.
	Hutch Waterfall	Welcome back to the Legion of Madfellows, man.
	Fry	Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? You could have just asked me to come with you. And where are we? This doesn't look like your regular dumpster.
	Nine	All in good time! I guess now is a good time. We're on Mars, in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native Martians a million years ago.
	Fry	Actually, it was five years ago. I remember 'cause they washed my socks.
	Nine	You have done well, Fry. You have ingratiated yourself with Leo Wong.
	Fry	Yup, I kissed his ass from cheek to shining cheek. So, what do I do next?
	Nine	As Wong security chief, you will be on hand when he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf. You must not let that happen.
	Fry	[He is taking notes.] "Must let happen."
	Nine	Not happen!
	Fry	"Must let occur."
	Nine	Let me tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that compared to them the human race is a mere college senior! On a distant planetoid they evolved to cooperate in their quest to survive.
	Fry	Cooperation, because life is a team sport.
	Nine	But, over time, one species evolved a better strategy, and an evolutionary arms race began.
	Nine	That concludes the audio-visual portion of our head-clonk and lecture.
	Fry	Wait, what happened to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know!
	Nine	[He sighs and turns the hologram back on. He uses the light to cast shadows on the wall his his hands.] The frogs, or possibly the snakes, evolved into vicious killing machines, honed by the merciless forces of natural selection and intelligent design. We call these the Dark Ones!
	Nine	Meanwhile, however, the second species evolved to fend off the Dark Ones, befriending and protecting all other living things.
	Fry	Even Celine Dion?
	Nine	Probably. We call these noble beings the Encyclopods, because their DNA incorporates the DNA of every endangered species they encountered, so they can recreate them if they go extinct.
	Fry	Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!
	Nine	Bingo.
	Transition Announcer	Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout.
	Labarbara	Now you know how it feels to be locked up in a go-go cage.
	Hermes	What the hell are you talking about?
	Labarbara	Shut your man-hole.
	Hermes	I feel dirty.
	Leela	Are you sure Fry is working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to be so evil, or to hold down a job.
	Amy	It's true, Leela. Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess.
	Leela	But the Fry I know wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone telephone and prove you wrong. [She walks over to a phone booth and tries to open the door. The camera pans down and reveals Frida's body is blocking the door.] Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!
	Labarbara	Sweet she-cattle of Seattle.
	Hermes	Not your strong suit, woman.
	Amy	Who could have done this?
	Leela	Your dad? Nixon?
	Amy	Fry?
	Leela	No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling. [They all scream.] So just stay calm while I call Fry.
	Fry	So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now?
	Nine	Wh-... [Hutch is cooking a can of food with the light of the hologram.] When the life-giving Chee receded, only the toughest organisms could adapt and survive, like the Dark Ones. [The Madfellows boo.] Many more died out, like the Encyclopods. But, and this is the great secret of our age, we believe they left an egg behind.
	Fry	Is it edible?
	Nine	We're not gonna eat it! Not unless we find a second one. No, Fry, we intend to hatch it!
	Hutch Waterfall	And that's where you come in.
	Fry	And here I am.
	Nine	At long last the tide of Chee has returned, and its nourishing flow has awakened the dormant egg.
	Fry	That's good.
	Hutch Waterfall	It's better than good. It's better. With its massive stash of DNA, the Encyclopod can reconstruct every species that ever went extinct.
	Fry	So, where is this egg?
	Nine	In the violet dwarf star system.
	Fry	And what does it look like?
	Nine	A violet dwarf star!
	Fry	You mean, the whole star is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi.
	Nine	Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed to the star to ensure its destruction.
	Fry	Dang! So what does this Dark One look like?
	Nine	[He sighs.] We don't know. I admit it's a horrifically grave situation.
	Hutch Waterfall	Don't sugarcoat it, Nine. The Dark Ones have been evolving so long, it could be anything or anyone. Or anybody.
	Fry	You mean, like, people?
	Hutch Waterfall	Any people. It will kill the egg, and every dude, woman and child who knows about it.
	Nine	Even our crazy caps will be useless at close range. That's why only you, with your defective unreadable brainwave, may be able to thwart them and usher in a new green age of wonder and...
	Fry	You're on Fry-time. Leela! Did you get my message?
	Leela	What message?
	Fry	Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?
	Leela	[She gasps.]So you did kill Frida Waterfall?
	Fry	What? No. I told her to tell you that I'm... Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela. Then I can explain... [Nine motions "No!"] Well, I can't explain anything, but we should talk anyway. Where are you?
	Leela	Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you?
	Fry	Near the Keeler Crater on Mars. Do you know it?
	Leela	I, I, uh... I think I read about it.
	Leela	[She is heard through a speaker on the Nimbus.] I'll meet you at the south rim in one hour. No moustaches.
	Zapp	Kif, set coordinates, 36-24-36. AKA, Leela.
	Fry	Ten minutes late. Ain't that just like a womanista?
	Leela	Psst. Are you alone?
	Fry	Of course, don't you trust me?
	Zapp	There's no escape, Leela. If you surrender, wave your shirt in the air.
	Leela	Fry, you traitor!
	Amy	Hop onto the magnet, Leela!
	Leela	Okay. One, two... [Her boots are pulled to the magnet. She screams and Fry laughs, but he is grabbed by the ears and pulled along with her. The Planet Express ship takes off with the Nimbus chasing after it.]
	Leela	[She throws him in the go-go cage.] I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry.
	Fry	I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal capybara, king of the rats! No, wait.
	Amy	Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them in the giant miniature golf course.
	Fry	But the course isn't finished. And there's no girls allowed.
	Amy	Fore! [She pulls the steering wheel to the right with her club.]
	Zapp	So, they want to play mini golf, eh? Two can play at that game. Or even four, depending on the number of ball colors available.
	Zapp	I choose pink.
	Kif	That's their color, sir.
	Zapp	The hell it is.
	Leela	They're gaining on us. We need a birdie on the windmill hole.
	Amy	Wait. Wait. Drop the boot!
	Kif	Sir, at our present speed, the computer predicts a 100% chance we'll be sliced in half. We'll never make it.
	Zapp	Not with that attitude, we won't. Same speed ahead!
	Zapp	We made it through, Kif. How many men did we lose?
	Kif	All of them.
	Zapp	Well, at least they won't have to mourn each other. Seal the airlocks, and draw the shades. Resume shooting.
	Fry	Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four!
	Leela	The mouth's too dangerous. I'm going for the nose.
	Amy	Don't be a sucker. You won't come out anywhere near the hole. You need to aim for the jaws just when they start to close.
	Leela	Start to close? Are you out of your...
	Leela	We made it!
	Zapp	Captaining 101 . Go for the nose.
	Bender	My arms are broken, I'll never paint again. [He starts crying.]
	Kif	You can't sue the military.
	Bender	I'm okay then.
	Zapp	Damage report.
	Kif	We lost all remaining food and oxygen, Captain. As well as our XM Radio antenna.
	Zapp	Then this chase is over. Kif, set course for the nearest XM repair facility. Meanwhile, we shall sing top hits from the '80s.
	Kif	Which '80s, sir?
	Zapp	For me, there are only one '80s. [The ships slowly heads away from the chase.] (VO): Smell like I sound, [Kif groans.] I'm lost and I'm found. [Kif groans.]And I'm hungry like the wolf.
	Hermes	The shot was too good! We're jamming straight for the hole.
	Zoidberg	We're gonna crash, even.
	Amy	Shmeesh, shmill out, shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Of course, a wormhole! We'll simply disappear and reappear in a... [They enter the wormhole.] ...nother part of the universe.
	Amy	We made it!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Uh, whaa...
	Leela	Crud nuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus.
	Zoidberg	Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting!
	Bender	Hey, look at that.
	Zapp	Well, well, well. My bloodhound-like instincts must have hunted them down while my other parts were throbbing to Duran Duran.
	Kif	Shall I initiate a pointless and potentially fatal pursuit?
	Zapp	Make it so.
	Bender	It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space.
	Leela	Look! The asteroid. Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals!
	Fry	Wow! It's incredible.
	Leela	But it'll be destroyed when Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. So why are you helping him?
	Fry	I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me.
	Leela	You keep saying that, but you have to give me something to go on or I...
	Planet Express Ship Alarm	Out of whale oil. Out of whale oil.
	Leela	[She gasps.] The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating.
	Zoidberg	Say, what's that violet-colored dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into?
	Leela	The violet dwarf star!
	Fry	Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole, so we're headed into the ball return.
	Zoidberg	Aye, what else now can go wrong?
	Zapp	[on the monitor] Ladies, you're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded again and again.
	Petunia	He'll never take me alive. [She starts hacking up smoke.]
	Leela	Don't give up yet. I've got one more trick up my sleeve.
	Amy	That's exactly the number we need.
	Zapp	Ah, the fairer sex.
	Zapp	Something's very wrong here, and yet a little bit right.
	Leela	Not so fast, Brannigan. [All nine of them have guns.]
	Bender	Even less fast, feministas! [He has a gun that controls nine other guns.]
	Leela	Bender?
	Bender	All two tons of me, and if you think that's shocking; wait 'til you see w...
