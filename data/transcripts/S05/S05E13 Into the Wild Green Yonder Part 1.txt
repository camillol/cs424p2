	Seth MacFarlane	You and I will be reborn,In a future place and time,If everything our Hindu brethren say is true.In an age of things that hover,You and I will still be lovers,And we'll say to ourselvesThat was then and this is, too.'Cause we'll still find the happening hot spots,We'll still cruise the cool casinos.You'll still fly me to the moon,Although the moon to which you fly me,Could be Phobos or Deimos.The psychic worms from Rigel Nine,Who control everything we do,Will make us think that was then,And 3010 is exactly the same as 1962.Don't expect any changes, my friend,That was then and this is, too.
	Bender	Wow, Mars Vegas. Long live the eternal city.
	Mr. Wong	Two, one, zero!
	Bender	Rest in hell, Crapville!
	Mrs. Wong	Out here in the desert, weâ€™re gonna build bigger, better Vegas.
	Mr. Wong	Bathtubs size of oceans, hookers size of bouncers.
	Bender	[He blubbers.] Hamburger!
	Worm Announcer	Stand clear of the closing jaws.
	Amy	So what's gonna be over there, Dad?
	Mr. Wong	That? That the oasis. [A bulldozer destroys a small area of trees and grass. A tree was missed, so a man sets it on fire with a flame thrower.] Future site of Oasis Hotel. [He laughs.] Take that, you stupid Mother Nature.
	Frida Waterfall	Okay. Let's hit him hard.
	Feministas	This land is your land. This land is my land
	Fry	Who are you noisy women?
	Frida	I'm Frida Waterfall, leader of the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you man-doze this beautiful gyno-desert.
	Mr. Wong	Well, I'm Leo Wong, and I say, "Boom!"
	Frida	What happened to my femi-necklace? And where's my mega-fem?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Is he badly hurt, Dr. Zoidberg?
	Zoidberg	I don't quite know how to say this. (Sobbing:) Fry is dead!
	Zoidberg	Wait, not dead. The other thing.
	Mr. Wong	Damn eco-broads! You can't even spray for eagles without upsetting these kooks. [He sprays a tree and two eagles fall out, then a cave man falls out.]
	Leela	Now, hang on. Before you do construction, don't you have to make sure you're not harming any native species?
	Mr. Wong	Already done! By top scientist.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Err, what? Oh, my, yes. You've got the go-ahead, Mr. Wong. This place is deader than last year's cat.
	Leela	No, it's not! There's precious life right here in this scum puddle. [He holds up a desert muck leech.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah! The desert muck leech. Amazingly, the entire species lives in this one tiny stink hole. (To Mr. Wong:) Killing these will be so much easier than exterminating those ponies.
	Leela	Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve... [She pets the leech, it makes a noise and then it bites and clamps onto her neck.] Get off me! [She throws it to the ground.]
	Bender	I'll get it with my trusty foot cups: Stompy and Smashy.
	Leela	No, don't kill it! We have to...
	Mr. Wong	There. They're not endangered anymore. They're extinct.
	Leela	No, they're not. I saved this one. And I'm gonna raise it and care for it, so the world will forever know what it's lost. [The leech then bites her eye and she screams.] You freaking slime wad! [She pulls is off her eye and stomps on it, then stops.] No. I killed it. It was the last of its kind. [The creature comes back to life and bites onto her knee.] Let go of me, you... [She holds her leg up and fries the leech with a laser from her Wristlomojacker.] Poor thing.
	Mr. Wong	Tell you what, Fry. You all promise not to sue me, I give you token for free entry in poker tournament. [He slips a poker chip into Fry's pocket on his shirt while Fry is still somewhat unconscious.] He took it, you all saw it!
	Bender	Maybe we did, maybe we didn't. [Leela runs across the screen behind them, battling the leech still.] What's in it for me, Bender?
	Mr. Wong	Okay, okay. Come back when New Vegas opens, I give you all free rooms, free dinner and free tickets to Celine Dion.
	Bender	Lose the Celine Dion tickets and you got yourself a deal.
	Mr. Wong	All right, damn it, done!
	Bender	All right, I scored.
	Zoidberg	Look out, Vegas, I've got a system. [He inserts a quarter and pulls the lever while laughing. The rolls of the machine land on "OUT OF ORDER," "OUT OF ORDER" and "NO REFUNDS."] Oh. I'm bankrupt.
	Fry	[He chuckles.] You said it, Hermes. He is pathetic, but lovable.
	Hermes	Yup. What? I said no such thing, man.
	Fry	I am not acting weird, Leela. Why is everyone talking at once?
	Leela	Fry, calm down and stop braining.
	Amy	Yeah, Fry, maybe you need to-
	Fry	You're right, Amy! Maybe I do need some fresh air.
	Bender	Man, I'm worried about him. But not enough to stop gambling for even a single second.
	Three Leos on the Machine	You win, damn it!
	Fry	Voices always yelling. Who - who said that? I'm not insane. Stop it. Stop talking in me!
	Hutch Waterfall	Voices bothering you, man? You need one of these doodangs. [He taps on his foil hat.]
	Fry	A foil hat? Of course, he likes pastrami. What about the dog's testicles? [Hutch puts his foil hat on Fry's head and the voices quiet.] Hey, it worked. The voices stopped.
	Hutch Waterfall	They've got a huge selection of carburetors... Hang on. Hang on. [He searches through a dumpster for a new hat and finds one with some pizza stuck to it.] That's better. My name's Hutch.
	Fry	Hi, Hutch. So what's with the obnoxious, shrieking voices? Are my fillings picking up The View?
	Hutch Waterfall	No, man. Truth is, it's other people's thoughts. You're a mind reader.
	Fry	Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Although, actually, it was sort of obvious.
	Hutch Waterfall	You don't believe me? Take off the helmet.
	Fry	I believe you.
	Hutch Waterfall	Seriously, do it. [Fry sighs and takes his hat off.] (Telepathically): Testing, testing. Do you read me?
	Fry	Loud and clear.
	Hutch Waterfall	What?
	Fry	I said, "Loud and clear." Only I said it with my thinker, not my talker.
	Hutch Waterfall	Whoa! Freaky. Why can't I read your thoughts?
	Fry	I don't know. Wait. What's that about a secret society?
	Hutch Waterfall	Never mind that. Just keep the foil on and you'll be okay. Also, it'll keep the Dark Ones from incinerating your brain.
	Fry	That's a plus.
	Hutch Waterfall	And don't ever, ever, ever tell anyone you can read minds, or the Dark Ones will get you like that. [He poorly snaps his fingers.] Hang on, pizza grease. Like that. [He snaps his fingers and Fry let's out a concerned wail.]
	Clamps	I'd like to get my clamps on those. Give her a jump, you know what I mean? [He laughs alone.]
	Donbot	Whoa, whoa. Show some decorum there, Clamps. This ain't no strip show. This is a beguiling display of the pornographic arts.
	Joey Mousepad	Yo, Skip, I can see a guy's butt.
	Michael's Wife	Oh, Michael, this is the perfect end to a perfect honeymoon.
	Michael	I love you so much.
	Bender	Is this seat taken?
	Michael	Actually, we...
	Bender	Slide me those chicken wings. So what part of Podunk you rubes from?
	Michael	The north-eastern.
	Announcer	Monsieurs et mademoiselles, our circus of the senses now arrives by steamboat in New Orleans, circa 2873. The muted lament of a trombone resonates through the fog, which lingers even now, months after the attack of the fog monster. With but one hope of restoring Gearoticus to his throne, our sensual fate rests in the gyrations of... Fanny.
	Bender	Oh. [He stops eating and watches Fanny move her fan around on stage. He stammers and his eyes extend out of his head to zoom in. They extend out farther, then his antenna extends and the woman next to him gasps.]
	Fanny	Yes?
	Bender	I'm Bender. Let's do it. [He holds out the flowers.]
	Donbot	Who is it, the Feds?
	Bender	[He gasps.] Aren't you the Donbot, head of the Robot Mafia?
	Donbot	Allegedly. And this is my beloved wife, Fanny, whose honor I would proudly defend with a power drill. Well, I gotta go drown a stoolie.
	Donbot	I'm gonna be in here a while, so do me a favor and drive my wife home. It's one of them self-driving cars, so just sit in the back and do whatever.
	Fanny	Oh, Bender, your lips are intoxicating. It's like kissing an ashtray full of hot wings.
	Bender	Aww yeahh!
	Fry	My God, I really can read minds. I have a superpower! There must be something great I can do with this.
	Fry	Hello, ladies, I can read your thoughts. [Punches are heard and Fry is thrown out of the room.] Oh, wait, that's invisibility.
	Fry	Poker. With my mind-reading abilities and my invisibility... Wait, no, just the mind reading. I can't lose!
	Fry	Sign me up for the tournament, please.
	Administrator	Okey-doke, Jiffy Pop. Entry fee's 50,000 smackers.
	Fry	50,000? Drat, all I have is my life savings and a token for free admission to this poker tournament.
	Administrator	Close enough. [He puts the wad of cash in his breast pocket.]
	Amy	You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife?
	Bender	Yup, this is her I'm making out with.
	Hermes	Bender, are you crazy?
	Bender	No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one.
	Fry	Psht, I'm not crazy.
	Leela	You sure you're okay, Fry? You do have tin foil on your head.
	Fry	So? You've got a leech on your neck. Oh, and speaking of sucking on your neck, want to go to a movie later?
	Elzar	Hey, there! How are you folks doing tonight?
	Bender	Great. What are the specials?
	Elzar	We've got a wonderful grizzly bear that's been dipped in cornmeal and lightly tormented. Questions?
	Amy	What was the bear's name?
	Elzar	Jojo.
	Amy	Ooh, I'll have him.
	Bender	Hide me!
	Joey Mousepad	Hey, Donbot, ain't that your wife what with you had that wedding with?
	Fanny	[While sauntering over to Donbot looking rather bloated.] Donbot, honey! What a pleasant shock! I was just having dinner alone, when suddenly you walk in on us.
	Donbot	Alone, huh?
	Bender	Where am I? I was exploring a wormhole through space many light years from this restaurant, when suddenly I was surrounded by darkness. (To Fanny:) Hot, sexy darkness. [He purrs sensually.] Oh, why, hello, Donbot! Hello, miss, have we met? [He shakes Fanny's hand.] I'm Bender. The world's most sexual robot. I mean, the world's most boundary-respecting robot.
	Donbot	Nice to see you, Bender. Welcome back to our universe. Listen, sugar, I stuck up the Burlington Coat Factory and got you a little something. It's a $49 value.
	Fanny	Donbot, I love you! (To Bender:) Not really.
	Bender	Man, this is great! I always wanted to nail a dame in a fur coat, and now's my chance. [He catches himself.] I mean, if you'll introduce me to one, sir. (To Fanny:) One as sexy as you, baby! Bender out. [He struts away while humming/scatting. Zoom on Donbot's eyes, they squint, showing Donbot is onto Bender.]
	Fanny	I never felt so alive, Bender. Listen, this turquoise-encrusted bra is worth 50 grand. Let's sell it and run off before the Donbot gets wise.
	Bender	[He sighs.] No. It will take a lot more money than that to make a girl like you happy.
	Fanny	No, it won't.
	Bender	Yeah, it will. Shut up! We'll run off, after I win the Universal Poker Championship! [He raises his hand to reveal his plan, reaches into Fanny's bosom, rips out the bra and slams it on the Administrator's counter.] One entry, please.
	Fanny	Bender, no! You're not lucky enough.
	Bender	Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky. [He bangs on his chest twice.] The scrap metal I'm made from included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico, who had just been sent to a glue factory.
	Fanny	They don't sound so lucky to me.
	Bender	Not without their shoes.
	Fanny	Here, Bendy, take this. It will give you 70% more luck. It's the Donbot's lucky robot's foot.
	Bender	All right! With two kinds of luck, I can't lose.
	Bender	No, wait, three. I stepped on a leprechaun.
	Joey Mousepad	Yo, you see this over here over there?
	Clamps	I'm powering up the clamps.
	Donbot	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let us not rush to judgement.
	Joey Mousepad	But, Skip, that was your lucky robot's foot what came off of your lucky leg.
	Donbot	[He turns his chair to the side and shows his missing appendage.] While it is true that I did wake up with only one foot this morning, there is no proof that my beloved Fanny was involved. Aside from the hacksaw I found under her pillow.
	Clamps	Well, what about that Bender guy? You want I should give him the clamps?
	Donbot	Not yet, Clamps. We are gonna sit tight and see if he wins the poker tournament. He does, that proves he's packing my lucky foot, in which event...
	Clamps	The clamps! Or a clamp-like device.
	Penn Jillette	Welcome viewers who fell asleep with the TV on! It's the 3009 no-limit hold 'em championship. [The crowd cheers.] I'm the massive head of Penn Jillette, and here with a color commentary, my partner Teller. [Teller's head is floating in his own jar. As always, he is deceased.] Our act really didn't change much when he died.
	Bender	Pardon me, I'm new to this game. Is this duffle bag big enough for all your money? [He laughs and sits down at the table.]
	Fry	[He walks up to the table.] Bender? Oh, boogers. We're in the same tournament. Quick, get your entry fee back before I bankrupt you.
	Bender	Pfft! In your dreams, nutloaf.
	Fry	Bite my shiny metal hat.
	Penn Jillette	Tex Connecticut, the pride of Kansas City, first to act. [He has a Queen and a Nine and calls the blinds.] Smiley Spiff, up next. [He has a Jack and a Ten and also calls.] Looks like Boobs Vanderbilt has a decent pair. Also, she's got two eights. [She calls.] And Bender Rodriguez picks up a lucky deal right off the bat. [He calls as well.]
	Bender	Woo! Two aces. I'm thinking guitar solo. [He mimics a guitar solo.]
	Fry	He puts his hat back down.] I fold.
	Penn Jillette	Holy crap! A stunning play by mentally ill newcomer Philip Fry. It's almost as if he knew Bender had two aces.
	Tex Connecticut	I'm out.
	Lrrr	I'm out.
	Bender	[He laughs and pulls in the chips.] Suck my luck!
	Donbot	See this gun? [He holds up a gun, but then he crumples it in his hand.] That's what I'm gonna do to Bender if he wins.
	Lrrr	All in. Call my mighty bid at your peril. [He growls at the table. Fry lifts his hat.] (Telepathically): My cards are awful, and I need a hug.
	Fry	I call your bluff.
	Lrrr	I shall annihilate... [Fry hugs him.] (Sobbing:) I just wanted to make my daddy proud.
	Lrrr's Father	Well, you didn't. I want you and your junk moved out by Monday.
	Penn Jillette	It's getting pretty intense, folks. Based on the state of decomposition of Teller's head, we're now in hour 19 of the tournament. And the first bad deal of the night for Bender.
	Bender	Hey, pal, help me out here. [He holds up his cards - a Seven and a Two.] This is the worst possible hand, right?
	Tex Connecticut	I'm all in.
	Bender	All in! I mean, fold. Whatever.
	Penn Jillette	[Leo deals the flop.] Well, Bender's luck just ran out. No card can save him from elimination.
	Boobs Vanderbilt	Oh, my gourds! He's dead. [A card falls on her as well.]
	Leo Wong	21, winner! [He pushes the chips to Bender.]
	Bender	Wooo! I'm so full of luck, it's shooting out like luck diarrhoea.
	Penn Jillette	Wake up, poker fans! We're down to our final two players in heads-up action for the Championship. Your perspective, Teller? [A rat eats Teller's left eye.]
	Bender	All in.
	Fry	But-but, you didn't even look at your cards!
	Bender	Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
	Leo Wong	Any day now, Fry. You in or out?
	Bender	What's the matter, Fry, you scared? Or just [He spins his head around and wiggles in fingers] crazy? [He laughs.]
	Fry	All right, all in. [Leo deals the cards.] Yes! Four aces!
	Bender	[Fry moves in to take the pot.] Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep, and then tell me what they are.
	Leo Wong	Two kings. And with three on the board, that gives Bender five kings.
	Fry	But how is that...
	Penn Jillette	I don't believe it. Bender has just been dealt the King of Beers, a coaster from the bar that somehow got mixed into the deck. But it still counts!
	Leo Wong	Bender win the Championship!
	Bender	[He eats the money.] That's some good money. [He then belches fire.]
	Fanny	[She comes running over with a suitcase.] You did it, Bender. You're the greatest.
	Bender	Tell me something I don't know, sweetass. Now, let's boogie. We'll be in Space Tahiti before the Donbot knows what hit him.
	Donbot	Now I am suspicious.
	Bender	Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave. Can we go now?
