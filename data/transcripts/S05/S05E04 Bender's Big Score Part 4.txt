	TV Announcer	[voice over] And now it's time for Everybody Loves Hypnotoad.
	Zoidberg	Even in a depression, the entertainment industry thrives.
	Fry	Are you okay, Leela?
	Leela	Yeah, I'm just a little down 'cause the only man I'll ever love left me at the altar. Plus I live in a dumpster.
	Zoidberg	[angry] You stay out of my dumpster!
	Announcer	We interrupt this episode of Everybody Loves Hypnotoad to bring you a special address from Earth President Nixon.
	Announcer	Please, Hypnotoad, it's beyond my control. No! Don't make me kill myseIf!
	Richard Nixon	My fellow Earthicans, I've just received some really great news. I'm about to close a deal that will allow us to buy Earth back from the scammers.
	Bender	That'll teach those scammers and me.
	Richard Nixon	Just when things looked darkest, I received an e-mail from the Andrrrrrrromeda Galaxy. lt seems we've won their quadrillion-dollar family sweepstakes!
	Leela	Oh, Lord.
	Richard Nixon	And all I had to do was hand over our last remaining land and water as collateral. So assuming all goes ... [Headless Body of Agnew grunts] What's that, Agnew? A telegram? [reads telegram] Baroo! There ... seems to have been some ... We've been scammed again, people. Prepare to evacuate Earth. I mean, New Scamadonia.
	Nudar;Fleb;Schlump	[Singing] Na-na-na-na, Na-na-na-na, Hey, hey, hey, We took your stuff!, etc.
	Leela	All aboard for Neptune!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, I don't want to go to Neptune. I'll be cold, and heavy.
	Nudar	Thanks for the planet, suckers.
	Bender	It's so cold, my processor is running at peak efficiency.
	Leela	What are you, a whining machine? lf you want to worry about something, worry about the Yetis.
	Zoidberg	Yetis? [Yetis growl from outside] Oh, Yetis.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Amy, you speak Yeti. What are they saying?
	Amy	I'm not sure, but it sounds like something to do with... "assaulting the interlopers."
	Leela	Don't mess with me, you ice-crapping snow-honkies. I just got dumped.
	Hermes	Sweet Yeti of the Serengeti, she's gone crazy eddie in the head-y.
	Inuit #2	Is that normal?
	Inuit #1	No. Perhaps if we were to cook and eat her slightly...
	Fry-2	Leave her alone. She just needs me to cheer her up. Wanna sword fight, girl?
	Fry-2	That male narwhal seems to be upsetting her. Get us out of here, Captain. Full fast ahead.
	Leroy	Damn whale keepers.
	Leela	Santa! We forgot he's based on Neptune.
	Santa	[Holding a missile launcher] Ho. Ho. Ho... [Drops missile launcher] Oh, my heart's not in it. I'm too depressed for murder and mayhem.
	Amy	Aw, try some antidepressants. They're gummy.
	Fry	What happened, Santa?
	Santa	The scammers cheated me out of my naughty list to use for telemarketing. Can you imagine the harm they could do with that information? I wanted to do that harm!
	Leela	That's it. They've gone too far. No more running and hiding. It's time to fight back.
	Santa	Now, let's not resort to violence, Leela.
	Leela	We're fighting back and you're helping us, you fat holiday idiot.
	Santa	That hurt. You're on the naughty list!
	Leela	So that's our proposal napkin, Mr. President. We have just enough people and ships to mount a ragtag attack.
	Richard Nixon	You wish, missy. Dog-danged scammers used our money to build a fleet of remote-controlled, solid-gold Death Stars.
	Bender	Ooh! I'd take one of those with a side of chili fries.
	Richard Nixon	We're hopelessly outgunned. The Force is with us, but that's about it.
	Santa	Ah, but we have access to a huge manufacturing complex.
	Kwanzabot	Kwanzabot
	Chanukah Zombie	[singing] And the Chanukah zombie.
	Neptunians	[singing] Damn you! Doo, doo, doodoo!
	Neptunians	[singing] Says who? Doo, doo, doodoo!
	Neptunians	[singing] Ten hut! Doo, doo, doodoo!
	Kwanzabot	[rapping, while Robot Santa beatboxes]
	Santa	[singing] Yeah, K?
	Kwanzabot	[singing] CZ?
	Santa	Can they sue for liability?
	Richard Nixon	Certainly not!
	Santa	[singing] Use as much as you are able.
	Neptunians	[singing] This bites. Doo, doo, doodoo!
	Leela	[singing] Now, let's fight.
	Richard Nixon	[singing, simultaneously] Let's fight.
	Neptunians	Doo, doo, doodoo!
	Santa;Chanukah Zombie;Kwanzabot	[singing] This trinity's going to war!
	Leela	Troops, you are now equipped with the finest weapons magical elves can build. As for the battle plan...
	Richard Nixon	And now, to present the battle plan, Commander Zapp Brannigan!
	Leela	What?
	Zapp	At ease, people. I was redecorating my undisclosed location when I received word of an heroic invasion. Kif, crouch down and shield my thighs from the cold, for God's sake.
	Zapp	We fight this battle, not for ourselves, but for our children and our children's children. Which is why I'm forming a children's brigade. Will the following youths please step forward? Cubert Farnsworth.
	Cubert	Here, sir!
	Prof. Farnsworth	My boy. Oh, God, no!
	Zapp	Dwight Slim.
	Dwight	Here.
	Hermes	You took his name? Oh, God, no! In several ways!
	Zapp	Assuming the 15th pile of children buys us a few seconds, we will then execute maneuver 45. Followed by maneuver 44.
	Kif	Forty-six.
	Zapp	Oh, great. Now I have to start back at the beginning with maneuver two.
	Kif	One.
	Lars	Admiral, will we stop attacking at any point or is this one of those phony-baloney, feel-good wars like the war on drugs?
	Zapp	What's your name, smart mouth?
	Lars	Lars Fillmore.
	Zapp	Ah, the lovely Leela's on-again, off-again paramour. Perhaps a suicide mission would knockthe insubordination out of you.
	Leela	Yes, yes, yes.
	Kif	We're approaching Earth, sir.
	Zapp	Who? Oh, planet Earth. The big blue velour marble. All commanders stand by. Prepare to transfer battle control to the main duper-computer on my mark! Ten, nine, eigh---[A Solid Gold Death star turns visible and shoots the Nimbus]
	Leela	Does anybody mind if I take command?
	Nibbler	No.
	Sal	Nos.
	Bubblegum	Nah.
	Al Gore	Nope.
	Cubert	No, Miss Turanga.
	Santa	No.
	Kwanzabot	It's cool.
	Chanukah Zombie	Argh!
	Leela	All right. Unit one, acquire target A and fire!
	Fleb	Yes! Nailed the children's ship.
	Leela	Unit 10, Target H, 16-K. Niner, niner, go left! I mean right.
	Sal	Whoas!
	Leela	55-U. 8-R, 2-V.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Bingo!
	Hattie	Cheating son of a...
	Al Gore	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
	Leela	It's hopeless! I can't coordinate this many ships!
	Hermes	Perhaps I can help! Professor, can you wire my head directly into the battle grid?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I can wire anything directly into anything. I'm the professor!
	Hermes	Then prepare to see a bureaucrat's brain in action.
	Al Gore	[Flying through a vent firing] Finally, I get to save the Earth with deadly lasers instead of deadly slide shows.
	Clamps	He's champing for a clamping!
	Kwanzabot	Kwa-zang!
	Hermes	I did it! I saved Earth and won back my woman. Right, woman?
	LaBarbara	Oh, Hermes, I've been such a fool. Truth be, I married you for your sexy potato body,but I'm staying with you for your sexy potato head.
	Slim	You haven't seen the last of Barbados Slim! Now, goodbye forever.
	Nudar	Nice attack, doo-doo heads! Too bad we have one last trick up our sleeve!
	Amy	I doubt that!
	Nudar	Remember this, Farnsworth?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Farnsworth? That's me! My doomsday device! So it was the scammers! They sawed off my hand and stole the doomsday device.
	Bender	lt wasn't them. lt was me, Bender. The master criminal!
	Nudar	So what'll it be? - Unconditional surrender?
	Leela	Never!
	Nudar	Or totaI destruction?
	Leela	Also never!
	Nudar	You have 30 seconds. Make up your minds!
	Leela	[Melodramatically] Nevvveeeeer!
	Bender	People, I'm sorry. You've never before heard me say those words, or even the individual letters that make them up. But I am. And with a huge amount of modesty, I humbly beg your forgiveness. [Bender pulls out a satchel of the Spheroboom, opens it, and drops it in the Axillary Torpedo slot]
	Bender	Shut up and keep looking apologized to.
	Leela	[Acting nonchalant] Dum de dum.
	Nudar	Uh-oh. I have a worrisome shriveling sensation in my sprunjer.
	Amy	Yay! Bender!
	Fry	All right!
	Fry	Bender, how the Hulk did you end up with the doomsday device?
	Bender	I was working the long con all along. While sawing off the professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had some time to think. So I asked myself, "Who could use a doomsday device more? The scammers or me, Bender?". After several minutes of sawing, I knew the answer. Me, Bender. So I retrieved the dummy satchel ...
	Bender	(VO) ... and as soon as I was out of the scammers' control, I pulled the old switcheroo.
	Bender	And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest!
	Richard Nixon	Bender the robot, I'm proud to present you Earth's highest award for swindling. The Dirty Double-Cross.
	Bender	I'll aways treasure it and immediately hock it.
	Lars	There, your body's good as new. Just pop in an executive suppository every few...
	Fry	What is it?
	Leela	Nothing.
	Fry	It's supposed to be a celebration, Leela. I mean, come on. Whimmy-wham-wham-whazle!
	Leela	I can't help it. I was gonna be married. I was so happy.
	Fry	Well, maybe you'll meet someone else someday.
	Leela	No, you don't understand. Lars is the only man I'll ever love. I know it in my heart.
	Fry	You remember when we first met?
	Leela	Uh-huh. lt was right there in the cryogenic lab, eight years ago today.
	Fry	Meet me there in five minutes. It's important.
	Fry-2	Why are you so sad, Leelu?
	Fry-2	Him again? [sudden realization strikes] Wait a second, are you two...
	Fry-2	Atanarjuat, Fufu, come here! We have to set Leelu free.
	Inuit #2	Dang. I never should have quit my job at the casino.
	Fry-2	Me, neither. But she needs what'll make her happy, not what'll make me happy.
	Fry-2	Goodbye, Leelu.
	Lars	I don't much know about frozen heads, but, of course, if it's Mahatma Gandhi, I'll... Leela?
	Leela	Lars?
	Lars	I... I really have to go, I...
	Leela	Fry, was this an idiotic trick to get Lars and me back together?
	Fry	Quite idiotic. But you don't need to be an idiot to see that you two belong together. And, Leela,I want what'll make you happy, not what'll make me happy.
	Lars	I'm sorry, I really am, but Leela and I just can't be married.
	Fry	Why not? You obviously love each other. What are you, cousins?
	Lars	Fry, you deserve to know the truth. It's because...
	Nudar	Nobody move!
	Leela	Nudar! How did you survive the doom blast?
	Nudar	My doom-proof platinum vest absorbed most of the radiation. In retrospect, I wish I'd been wearing doom-proof pants, but you know us nudists. Now give me the time code!
	Fry	I don't have it! Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt.
	Nudar	Not you.
	Nudar	You!
	Leela	Lars? He doesn't have it. He never had it. Fry had it!
	Fry	But Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt! I want to stress that part!
	Nudar	My throbbing sprunjer says otherwise. Now where is it?
	Lars	I'm not afraid of you or your expensive gun! Go ahead and shoot!
	Nudar	Oh, yeah? Then what if I kill the woman you love?
	Leela	Don't you understand, numb-neck? He doesn't love me!
	Lars	[crying] I've... always loved you. Don't hurt her. I'll give you the code.
	Nudar	What the...
	Bender-2	[monotone] Four, three, two, [normal voice] one, Boom! [Nothing happens. Bender-2 laughs] Woah!
	Leela	Lars, no!
	Fry-2	[Looking at a picture of Leelu] It's enough just to know you're happy.
	Fry-2	[Looking at a picture of Leela and crying] You, too. It's enough to know you're happy with Lars.
	Bender	Fry, old buddy! It's me! Bender! [Bender fires his gun]
	Fry-2	My hair!
	Fry-2	My larynx!
	Lars	I'm Lars? I'm Lars!
	Fry	Wait for me, Leela! I'll be there in a thousand years.
	Lars	[On a screen] So I got a job at the Head Museum and waited for the wonderful day when Leela would arrive. Everything was perfect until Hermes exploded at our wedding. That's when I learned that, as a time paradox duplicate, I, too, was doomed. I couldn't put Leela through that. So I called it off. I'm sorry, Leela.
	Leela	[sad] I understand.
	Crazy Guy	That concludes another Silly Willy Wideo Will!
	Fry	He was a good man, Leela.
	Leela	Yeah... you were.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, I guess that wraps everything up in a nice, paradox-free bow.
	Bubblegum	Not quite, my wrinkly brother.
	Nibbler	Right on! In order for any of this to make any sense at all, someone must make one final trip back in time to put the code on Fry's ass in the first place!
	Bender	Sounds like a job for me, Bender.
	Bender	Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero...
	Bender	Mission accomplished!
	Fry	You put the time code on my ass?
	Bender	Someone's ass. Oh, and guess what? I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to.
	Nibbler	No! No! Everyone out of the universe! Quick!
	Bender	What's the worst that can happen?
	Bender	Well, we're boned.
