	Roberto	Previously, on Futurama. Hah-haa! [he stabs the camera]
	Dwight	A terrifying red dragon!
	Bender	I make use of my rod of fireballs. [He makes explosion noises.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. [She is shocked.]
	Leela	Ouch!
	Fry	Bender, I think you might be [visuals cut to Bender running around with a sword, wearing a pot on his head. A bus hits him] playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
	Bender	You're absolutely right, Fry. [visuals cut back to the kitchen] Now, if you'll excuse me. [He places the pot on his head.] I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain. [He waves his arms around, makes gibbery noises and dives head first out the window.]
	Dr. Perceptron	Please, send in the patient.
	Intercom Assistant	Yes, Doctor. [An arm extends out a pulls a lever on the desk. Bender falls from a door in the ceiling, still in the straight jacket, into a chair.]
	Bender	Wee!
	Dr. Perceptron	So, (Low monotone voice:) Bender, (Normal voice:)I understand you're having trouble separating fantasy from reality.
	Bender	Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again?
	Dr. Perceptron	I understand. Commence therapy. [He pushes a button on his clip board. A hammer comes down from the door in the ceiling and begins striking Bender on the head.]
	Fry	Poor Bender. Says here to tell his friends he's at a spa.
	Amy	So what happened to Bender?
	Fry	He's at a spa.
	Amy	Wow, there's a spa in the nut house?
	Zoidberg	Friends, friends, stop everything. There's food in this shaker. [He begins sucking the salt out of a salt shaker, accidentally swallows it and sneezes mucus all Leela, who becomes angry and is administered a shock.]
	Leela	Ow! Can you please remove this anger collar?
	Hermes	Are you still angry?
	Leela	(Assuring): No. [She is shocked.] Ow!
	Hermes	It also shocks you when you lie.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Quiet, everyone. The network news is on and if I, a 165-year-old man, don't watch it, who will?
	Morbo	Thankfully, the amazing talking horse was rescued and safely returned to the meat department.
	Linda	[She laughs.] Turning to the less stupid portion of our broadcast, fuel prices hit an all-time high today due to the ongoing dark matter shortage.
	Morbo	Earlier, our own Morbo sat down with Mom, CEO of Mom's Friendly Multinational Energy Conglomerate.
	Morbo	[He sips his tea.] Morbo the Annihilator, here, sitting down to a delightful tea in this fake living room set. (Shouting:) Thank you for joining us, Mom.
	Mom	My pleasure, sugarplum.
	Morbo	Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine. Why are fuel prices so high?
	Mom	Oh! It's terrible, isn't it? Dark matter is just so rare nowadays, but we'll keep pinching loaf after loaf from the bowels of the earth, even if I lose money on every log.
	Morbo	If you are losing money, how did you post record profits last quarter?
	Mom	You look thin, care for one of my famous pecan clusters?
	Morbo	[He reaches for one, but hesitates.] Morbo shouldn't. It will go straight to Morbo's gargantuan forehead. Oh, what the heck? I guess I could destroy one or two of them. [He devours the entire plate and all of the cookies.]
	Mom	Do people care enough to drill for dark matter even in an Alaskan wildlife refuge? People do.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Greedy old hag, taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper. [He hurls the slipper toward the TV, but it doesn't make it and floats to the ground.]
	Leela	Professor, why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oohh... I bet you'd like to know. I bet you'd like to know, indeed.
	Walt	Hello, Mother. How did the interview go?
	Mom	It made me want to puke my face off. Where's my Thigh Blaster?
	Larry	Right here, Mom.
	Mom	Shut up!
	Larry	Okay, thank you.
	Mom	Burn, you damn thighs. Burn!
	Igner	Mommy, are you upset 'cause of the dark matter shortage?
	Mom	There is no shortage, you moronic ass-brain!
	Inger	There's not? But you said...
	Mom	[She sighs.] Allow me to explain. Suppose this hand represents current reserves of dark matter and this hand represents consumer demand.
	Igner	Uh-huh.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I just bet you'd like to know why I'm so angry about this dark matter shortage. I bet very much you'd like to know.
	Amy	You're right, Professor. We would like to know.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Really? I didn't think anyone was interested. It all started 30-odd years ago. [Farnsworth starts a VO. Fade to a flashback of Farnsworth sitting at a desk. He is molding a chemistry model and Mom joins him, similar to the scene from Ghost.] I was working in Mom's laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again. But somehow the rich, wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back.
	Zoidberg	Don't stop, Professor. I'm getting aroused. [His mating fin rises.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Back in those days, dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity, and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator, in an ill-conceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax. But, as Deepak Chopra taught us, quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason. Also, eat plenty of oatmeal and animals never had a war. Who's the real animals? [Small pause.] And thus against all probabilities... it happened. [The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding. A large explosion leaves only a single item - the single non-local metaparticle crystal.
	Younger Farnsworth	Dang!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm sure I don't need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single non-local meta-particle.
	Amy	Guhh! Stop patronizing us.
	Younger Farnsworth	So, in one instant, I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form... (Younger Farnsworth to Younger Mom:) ...making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave.
	Younger Mom	I'm intrigued, Hubert. You have my undivided attention.
	Younger Mom	Shut up, you milk-sucking leeches! A new super fuel, eh? We're rich.
	Younger Farnsworth	Indeed, we are.
	Younger Mom	Not you, we. Us, we. [A younger Wernstrom walks into her arm.] I'm getting back together with my ex-husband.
	Younger Farnsworth	WernstromÂ !
	Younger Wernstrom	You've been played, Farnsworth. Played like a cheap harpsichord.
	Younger Mom	Walt, fire that employee like Mommy taught you.
	Leela	Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom. I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss.
	Fry	Me, too.
	Zoidberg	Ditto!
	Hermes	Likewise.
	Amy	I made a blinding powder.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Thanks, but that won't be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon. [Cut to the scene when the first crystal was created. A black crystal shoots out of the machine and Farnsworth puts it in his pocket. VO:] You see, in the instant the energy crystal was created, there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure anti-backwards energy.
	ALL	Wow!
	Hermes	So?
	Prof. Farnsworth	So, this! If ever the two crystals should meet, their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burr's trampoline, once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel.
	Hermes	But then we'll have no fuel.
	Prof. Farnsworth	But once we free society from dependence on Mom's dark matter, scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner, alternative fuels.
	Fry	Scientists like you!
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, not me. I'm too busy developing makeup for dogs. That's where the money is.
	Leela	[Her collar is active during her rousing.] This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson. Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal.
	ALL	Yeah.
	Hermes	Fight the power!
	Prof. Farnsworth	There's just one, small problem, and it's a big one. I hid the crystal and I can't remember where.
	Hermes	Surely it's just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher...
	Prof. Farnsworth	Don't you think I already tried that? No. I'm afraid, the crystal is lost forever.
	Dwight	Nine? You did it. You outwitted the fungus.
	ALL	Woohoo!
	Chinese Boy	Who needs girls?
	Dr. Perceptron	Since you have all proven resistant to individualized hammer therapy, I now prescribe group therapy.
	Rosie	Everything must be clean, very clean. That's why the dog had to die. He was a dirty dog. Dirty, dirty. Also, that boy, Elroy. Dirty, dirty.
	Dr. Perceptron	Who would like to share their feelings?
	Intercom Assistant	I feel unappreciated at work.
	Dr. Perceptron	What? I can barely understand you.
	Intercom Assistant	I said I feel...
	Mad Hatterbot	Change places.
	Roberto	Well, well. Looks like old Roberto is the focus of attention now. Stop looking at me. [He makes his "knifing" noises.]
	Dr. Perceptron	Calm down, Roberto. Tell us about your childhood.
	Roberto	I was designed by a team of engineers attempting to build an insane robot. But it seems they failed.
	Convenience Store Bot	Um, actually... [He is stabbed, then coughs up some candy bars.]
	Bender	Look, we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem.
	Roberto	Amen.
	Dr. Perceptron	Good, Bender.
	Rosie	That's right.
	Bender	There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor.
	Roberto	Say what? Dude's crazy.
	Dr. Perceptron	Bender, please, try to...
	Bender	I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
	Dr. Perceptron	You are suffering a breakdown. [He pushes a button and a hammer smashes his glass head.] I'm in your seat. I forgot we had changed places.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone!
	Amy	You perfected dog mascara?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Far from it. If you ask me, they look like a bunch of hookers. But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal. [Everybody gasps.] When I push this button, the crystal will emit a high-frequency stink.
	Zoidberg	[He is putting on eye mascara.] Hurray!
	Prof. Farnsworth	There. Now, with any luck I'll detect it with my smelling aid. [He sticks a device in his nose and it begins beeping.] I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does.
	Hermes	Do you smell the crystal, Professor?
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, damn it! Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels.
	Dwight	Dude. Who whipped an egger?
	Cubert	He who smelled it, dealt it.
	Dwight	Well, he who denied it, supplied it.
	Cubert	Well, he who articulated it, particulated it.
	Dwight	Well, he who refuted it, tooted it.
	Cubert	Stalemate.
	Mom	Jesus craps. The anti-backwards crystal.
	Larry	Ow! Ah... sorry?
	Mom	Relax, it's not your fault. [She slaps him again.] I can't believe it still exists. Google the hell out of that skanker. [The map zooms into Planet Express.] Planet-sucking-Express? Of course. How could I have been so dumb? [She slaps herself.] With that crystal, Farnsworth could completely destroy my dark matter empire. I underestimated that sagging old bag of bones and gonads.
	Inger	Is that man bad?
	Mom	Very bad, Igner. And that's why I need you three to go steal the anti-crystal away from him. But be careful. You'll need all your stoogely cunning.
	Walt	Exterminators.
	Fry	Oh, great. What do we got? Wall gophers? Toilet snails?
	Walt	No, I'm afraid you've got owls. Over there, see?
	Igner	Ow!
	Walt	Dump the bag, you nitwit.
	Larry	Hey, watch it. [He holds up a mouse trap.]
	Walt	Quiet, you. [He gets his hand caught in the mouse trap.] Ow!
	Fry	I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any... Oh, there they are. Gross.
	Walt	We've got to act fast. Larry, get out the geigersniffer.
	Larry	You're just gonna hit me with it.
	Walt	No. I'm going to hit you with this. [Walt hits Larry's shield on his mask and knocks him over. Cut to the lounge, the three can still be head in the background as Leela and Amy sit on the couch. Fry enters.]
	Fry	Those three exterminators are hilarious.
	Amy	Really? I don't think so.
	Leela	Me, neither. Now, Sex and the City, that's funny.
	Dwight	After wandering aimlessly in the swamp, you suddenly... [He rolls the dice.] wander aimlessly in the swamp.
	Walt	There it is. [Larry and Igner walk into him after he has stopped.]
	Cubert	Uh, excuse you.
	Walt	I'm sorry, little boy. You see, we're owl exterminators.
	Igner	We are owl extermin... [Larry pulls the ladder back and lets it hit Igner in the head.] Ow!
	Walt	And what we have here is an owl egg that's about to hatch into an owl larva. So, if you don't mind, we'll just take this and...
	Cubert	[He scoffs.] What are you, stupid? That's a dodecahedral crystal I found hidden in the downstairs walrus tank.
	Dwight	And I wrote numbers on it so we could use it as a D12, 'cause I have the best handwriting.
	Cubert	Do not.
	Dwight	Do too.
	Cubert	Do not.
	Dwight	Do too.
	Cubert	You win this round.
	Prof. Farnsworth	What's going on here?
	Igner	We're owl exterminators.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh? Then you won't have any problem exterminating this owl.
	Prof. Farnsworth	My anti-backwards crystal. So it's you three. I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work. Walt, the leader among imbeciles.
	Walt	Hey! They resent that.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Larry, the snivelling middle child.
	Larry	Sorry. Thank you.
	Prof. Farnsworth	And you, Igner. The evil I could tolerate, but the stupidity... [He shudders.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good God. Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo. [The boys start laughing.] Now, get out and tell Mom thanks for the crystal. [He laughs while staring at the crystal. Cut to the three brothers standing in front of Mom.]
	Igner	Thanks for the crystal.
	Fry	There. The repairs are complete.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[He honks the horn.] Let's go, already. We've got to infiltrate Mom's dark matter mine, now. How do you start this thing? [Fry ducks out of the way as flames shoot out of the thrusters. Cut to a shot of Leela sifting through Nibbler's litter box. Farnsworth honks the honk again.] Good Lord, woman. Can you move any slower? [He honks the horn again.] Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank.
	Leela	Well, there isn't any dark matter. Nibbler hasn't pooped at all. And he ate a whole family of koalas last night. Nibbler! Nibbler!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesy-fruitsy space rat. The only thing that matters right now is this crystal. [He throws the crystal at Leela's head.]
	Leela	Ow!
	Prof. Farnsworth	And be careful with that crystal. [The ship takes off.]
	Dr. Perceptron	Even relaxation therapy has failed. Nurse, schedule a robotomy for Bender.
	Nurse Ratchet	Yes, Doctor. I'll get the tools from the shed.
	Dr. Perceptron	It's a very painful procedure. So until then, just try to relax.
	Mom	What are you laughing at?
	Larry	Your laugh. It's just so infectious.
	Mom	So's herpes. Now, shut up! You and Walt, lead the killbots to the surface and blow Farnsworth out of the sky.
	Walt	What about Igner?
	Mom	That hairless ape? I swear. When he came out I flipped a coin whether to keep him or the after-birth.
	Walt	Yes, Mother. You told that story at his graduation.
	Mom	I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Igner I've never told anyone. And here it is.
	Walt	Continue returning fire.
	Killbot 1	[He turns to them while firing.] What?
	Killbot 2	[He turns around while firing too.] What did they say?
	Killbot 1	I don't know. I can't hear a thing.
	Killbot 3	[He turns around as well.] Hey, what's everybody talking about?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Mayday! Mayday! [Walt and Larry flee from the defence line.] Oh, God. I cannot believe this is the best plan I could come up with. [The ship crashes just in front of the Killbots. Pull back to reveal Farnsworth holding a controller. He flicks a switch and a light goes off. Fry and Leela sit in the snow bank with him.] We weren't actually in the ship.
	Leela	Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine.
	Fry	Hmm, uh, ladies first. [She pushes him through the blades, picks up Farnsworth and hops through. They're walking through a tunnel.] Phew! That blade missed me by the skin of my pants. [His pants have been cut open. The crew throw their jackets into a bin labelled "CLOTHES FOR THE GREEDY." Farnsworth presses the call button on a maintenance elevator.]
	Elevator Steward	Maintenance shaft 7 serving...
	Prof. Farnsworth	Shut your mouth.
	Elevator Steward	I'm just talking about the shaft.
	Fry	Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?
	Leela	Actually, feels kind of good. I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.
	Walt	We shot them down, Mother. The intruders never even got to Sector 1 .
	Security Woman	(on PA): Intruders in Sector 15. Intruders in Sector 15.
	Mom	Ugh... Sometimes I don't know why I even bother to slap you. [She slaps them twice.] (on PA:) All Killbots to Sector 15.
	Killbot 1	[He turns to the other Killbot and shoots him.] What did she say?
	Killbot 2	[He turns to the other Killbot and shoots him.]What did you say? [The two of them stay position towards each other and eventually destroy themselves. Fry, Farnsworth and Leela dash by their bodies. Another view of a hallway shows balls of Dark Matter being transported through tubes.]
	Fry	There are so many killbots behind us I can't count them all. Three, I think.
	Leela	We're trapped.
	Prof. Farnsworth	The main pit must be in here. I'm detecting vast quantities of Dark Matter.
	Leela	Step aside turkey-neck. I think I know the code. [She punches the keypad and the door opens. They get in and slam it shut before the Killbots spot them.]
	Prof. Farnsworth	We're in. We're in the heart of the mine. The very source of all Mom's wealth and... [He lets out a long winded, girly scream. Pull away from them at the door down a huge room with caged Nibblonians occupying it. There are more floors featuring the same thing above and below. Cut to shots of the caged Nibblonians, their poop is being harvested and transported through clear pipes.]
	Leela	My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.
	Fry	Is there really so much of a distinction? I mean...
	Nibbler	(From offscreen:) Leela, it's me, Nibbler.
	Leela	Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler. I think I'm going to vomit.
	Nibblonian	Nibbler is over there.
	Leela	Oh, sorry. Nibbler!
