	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting; from inside] Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!
	Fry	[shouting] I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am. So how 'bout a date tonight?
	Leela	[shouting] Sorry. I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on.
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting; from attic] Buddha! Zeus! God! One of you guys do something!
	Fry	[shouting] Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting; from attic] Help! Satan! You owe me!
	Leela	[shouting] Look, um, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to: I can't go out tonight because... [The shaking stops but Leela still shouts.] I have sweaty boot rash.
	Amy	No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
	Fry	So, will you go out with me?
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, everyone. I'm still technically alive. Yes! [He lifts something up off the floor.] But I need to you to dispose of this crazy-ass experiment that almost killed me. [He puts a box on the table.] You'll have to throw it into the sun itself. For only the thermo-nuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction.
	Bender	I can hit it with a shovel.
	Professor Farnsworth	That's not good enough.
	Bender	This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, yes.
	Zoidberg	So what's in the box, already?
	Professor Farnsworth	No peeking! [He hits Zoidberg with a hammer. Zoidberg cries out in pain.] I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it.
	Hermes	Ow! You hurt my collator!
	Professor Farnsworth	I don't care. [He stands up.] Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden! [He shakes his fist in the air then rubs the lid.] Pretty tantalising though!
	Fry	Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
	Zoidberg	In my experience, boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni! [He clasps his claws together.] What a day that was! [He screams and pushes Fry and Bender out of the way.] [shouting] Give me the box!
	Hermes	Scram, you lousy green snakes! [Fry, Bender and Zoidberg run out.] Here, Leela. Take this and use it to shoot those guys.
	Leela	Right. If they try to look in the box.
	Hermes	Whatever.
	Fry	Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
	Bender	Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?
	Fry	No.
	Bender	That's what makes it so funny! [He laughs then suddenly stops.] OK, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me.
	Fry	[from vent] Ow! It's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting.
	Bender	We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive.
	Fry	Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them.
	Bender	And unlabeled booze! Wide-mouth too!
	Leela	That oughta keep those dopes occupied. [She stands up and pulls a sheet off something.] I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
	Leela	Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek. [She sighs.] I need coffee. [She walks to the coffee machine and is about to put the coin in but looks back at the box.] OK, heads I look, tails I don't. [She flips the coin and covers it. She lifts her hand and smiles.] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Heads! I mean, alright then. No! I have a duty not to look. Well, then again, I promised the coin I would. [She lifts the lid off the box and puts her head inside.] Oh, it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be.
	Leela A	Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
	Fry 1	Leela, what have you done?
	Leela A	Nothing. What do you mean "Why was I looking in the box?"
	Fry 1	I mean your hair. It's all different-y.
	Leela A	Bender? Is that you?
	Bender 1	You know it! Large and in charge!
	Farnsworth 1	Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box.
	Leela A	I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
	Bender 1	No, that's how you always look. [Another Leela walks in carrying a mug. Her hair is red and her trousers are tinged red.] This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long-lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker.
	Fry 1	It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!
	Leela A	Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.
	Fry 1	You shut up, sir!
	Farnsworth 1	No, wait! I've got it. I know what's in the box. Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry.
	Fry 1	Am not!
	Farnsworth 1	It contains a parallel universe. And when you create a parallel universe, it's almost always populated by evil twins.
	Leela A	Now, look: I am not evil. My loan officer said so.
	Farnsworth 1	Oh, you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you, Leela? Or should I say Evil-a?
	Bender 1	Oh, this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best, damnit!
	Farnsworth 1	Leela? [Both Leelas look at him.] Uh, the good Leela. [Leela 1 smiles.] I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are. [He hands her Hermes' laser.] Here.
	Leela A	I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
	Zoidberg A	[from Universe A] Hello!
	Leela 1	[from Universe A] Hi-yah!
	Zoidberg A	[from Universe A] Ow!
	Leela 1	Come out of your universe with your hands up!
	Fry A	Oh, wow! It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.
	Farnsworth A	Astonishing! I must have created a parallel universe.
	Farnsworth 1	Baldercrap! I created your universe. All you created was my fist parallel to your face.
	Farnsworth A	Ow.
	Leela A	Look, it doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is-- Yah!
	Leela 1	[whispering] We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand.
	Farnsworth 1	Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
	Farnsworth A	Let's recap what's happened so far. [He presses a button and a hologram appears over the table.] As you can see, I accidentally created a box containing your universe.
	Farnsworth 1	While I, in a simultaneous blunder, created a box containing your universe.
	Leela A	This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe "Universe A" and this universe "Universe B"?
	Bender 1	Hey! Why can't we be Universe A?
	Fry 1	Yeah!
	Amy 1	Yeah!
	Farnsworth 1	We want A!
	Zoidberg 1	It's the best letter!
	Fry A	We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a "B", y'know?
	Leela 1	Alright, you can be crummy Universe A and we'll be Universe 1.
	Fry 1	Or "The Mongooses". That's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!
	Farnsworth A	Wait a second. If everyone is identical, why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?
	Leela 1	Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look.
	Leela A	That's weird. Mine came up heads, so I did.
	Farnsworth A	Interesting. Apparently, the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes.
	Bender A	That explains fruity here! [He points at Bender 1.] I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Fog hat grey!
	Bender 1	Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!
	Farnsworth A	You people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?
	Farnsworth 1	Oh, you'd like to get back to your evil universe, wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it.
	Farnsworth A	Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that!
	Farnsworth 1	Wha?
	Farnsworth A	You heard me!
	Farnsworth 1	In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden until I'm convinced you're not evil. [He turns to his staff.] Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart.
	Farnsworth A	And you all do the same!
	Leela 1	Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight.
	Leela A	[stunned] You guys are dating?!
	Fry 1	Oh, no, no. We're married.
	Bender A	I've got my eye on you, boy!
	Bender 1	Don't even think about it, lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground.
	Bender A	Good point. Whattya say we just hit a strip joint?
	Bender 1	I was waitin' for one of us to say that! [They cheer.] Bender A, you're a prince among robots. Can you forgive me for distrusting you?
	Bender A	Aw! I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!
	Amy 1	This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend!
	Amy A	I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel. We're exactly the same, right down to the-- [She sees Amy 1's toes.] Splech! Is that pink nail polish?
	Amy 1	Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's right, you are evil. And shallow.
	Amy A	I am not evil!
	Leela A	So, Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?
	Fry 1	Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me.
	Leela 1	I'd make up stuff like "I have sweaty boot rash" or "I have to meet the President"!
	Fry 1	Oh, man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now, it's kinda funny.
	Fry A	[sarcastic] It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!
	Leela 1	Then one night, when Fry asked me out, the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it, so I did what I always do in those situations.
	Leela A	Oh, Lord...
	Leela 1	I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out.
	Fry A	You mean you flipped a coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.
	Leela 1	You really missed out on something, Leela. That date was magical.
	Fry 1	One year later, I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married.
	Leela A	Ooh!
	Fry A	One year later, I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie!
	Farnsworth 1	Well, that was pointless.
	Farnsworth A	Say, I hope you won't think it "evil" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound.
	Farnsworth 1	Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain.
	Farnsworth A	Of course! I had the same idea. I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed. But it came up tails, so I didn't. How'd it go?
	Farnsworth 1	Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!
	Farnsworth A	Oh, you!
	Zoidberg 1	So, tell me about yourself.
	Zoidberg A	Well, don't look into it, but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor. Ooh! A can!
	Zoidberg 1	As for me, I design mansions, then live in them. [He bursts into tears.] [crying] I'm lying! I'm an appalling failure!
	Zoidberg A	[crying] Me too! A big, fat one!
	Zoidberg 1	And those co-workers, always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they, from Nob Hill?
	Zoidberg A	They're all like "Stop spraying me with ink, Zoidberg!" "Put on pants, Zoidberg!" "Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg!"
	Zoidberg 1	Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it?
	Zoidberg A	Bah! Someday they'll watch from down in the gutter, they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box.
	Zoidberg 1	You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box.
	Farnsworth 1	Good news, everyones!
	Farnsworth A	After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil.
	Farnsworth 1	Yes, the Bible is the real good news. Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe.
	Hermes 1	What's goin' on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?
	Leela 1	Hermes, aren't you curious about the fact that there's two of everybody?
	Hermes 1	No. Now like my granny used to say back in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay, "If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."
	Farnsworth 1	Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here.
	Farnsworth A	Oh, go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe...
	Farnsworth 1	Then your Hermes...
	Farnsworth A	Oh, my!
	Narrator	[voice-over] And sure enough...
	Hermes	Like Granny said, "If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself." God rest her zombie bones.
	Leela A	So we go back through the box and stop Hermes?
	Farnsworth A	Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!
	Farnsworth 1	[on radio] It's gone!
	Zoidberg A	All hail Zoidberg, the king with the box! [He kisses Zoidberg 1's feet.] Now it's my turn, maybe?
	Zoidberg 1	The box says no.
	Narrator	[voice-over] Meanwhile in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun ... A.
	Hermes	Item one: Box. Check! Item two: Sun. [He looks at the sun and shields his eyes.] That's a big check.
	Hermes 1	[crying] If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now.
	Bender 1	Our universe is doomed!
	Bender 1;Bender A	Doooooooomed!
	Farnsworth 1	Now don't give up yet, you cry babies. The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope.
	Amy A	Is it a kind of hairspray?
	Farnsworth A	No! We must attempt to make another box containing our universe. Doy!
	Fry 1	Well? Is that your universe in there?
	Fry A	[from box] Nope. Too cold.
	Farnsworth A	[from box] Hmm! All women! [He comes out of the box covered in lipstick marks.] I'll put this one aside for later.
	Hermes 1	Oh, man, it's hopeless! We'll never find your universe in time. Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head.
	Farnsworth 1	Yes, it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it.
	Bender 1	I'm not sad because I finally found someone as great as me. It's like I always say, "Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver--"
	Bender A	"And the other's gold."
	Zoidberg 1	Why with the long faces?
	Leela 1	The idiots have the box!
	Zoidberg A	I think she means you.
	Farnsworth 1	Grab them!
	Zoidberg 1	[shouting] You coward! Wait for me!
	Amy	Blug! Which one did they go into?
	Farnsworth A	[sarcastic] Oh, let's all ask each other! That'll solve this problem!
	Farnsworth 1	We'll each have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back.
	Amy 1	Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?
	Hermes 25	We didn't see anything ... [Leela 25, Hermes 25 and Fry 25 turn around. They have no eyes.] ... ever!
	Fry	Yo! Uh, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?
	Fry 1729	Hell, no!
	Leela 1729	Shut up!
	Bender 1729	Beat it, jerk!
	Leela A	Uh, have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?
	Fry 31	[mechanical voice] Negative. Will you go out with me?
	Leela A	Uh, access denied.
	Bender 1	Hey, pal, look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe!
	Bender	Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine ... if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!
	Bender 1	Faith and begorra!
	Farnsworth XVII	Quae?
	Zoidberg A	Quick! Into another box!
	Zoidberg 1	There aren't any in this universe, there aren't. Hey, you, what with the no boxes?
	Farnsworth 420	Baby, they're somewhere. Everything's like somewhere! Place is kinda au naturel right now.
	Farnsworth 1	There they are!
	Farnsworth A	Gotcha!
	Farnsworth 420	Dig it! All of you fitting in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!
	Farnsworth 1	Nonsense! Why, there's a whole universe in there.
	Farnsworth 420	Dude, there's a universe in all of us.
	Amy 420	Right on, Professor Freaksworth!
	Farnsworth A	Get a job! [He leans over the parabox.] [shouting] We've got the box. Everyone, pull your wires.
	Farnsworth A	Hurry! Back to Universe A!
	Farnsworth A	Hermes, don't press that button!
	Hermes	OK.
	Fry A	Bye.
	Leela A	Good luck, Leela.
	Zoidberg A	So long, Your Majesty!
	Amy 1	Later!
	Fry	There but for the flip of a coin go we. So, um, Leela? Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? You know, together?
	Leela	Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.
	Fry	So, heads or tails?
	Leela	Y'know, let's just say it's heads.
	Professor Farnsworth	Ready?
	Professor Farnsworth	and One, two, three, pull!
	Professor Farnsworth	There. That space-time eversion has given us their box and vice versa.
	Leela	So, what you think you just explained to us is that--
	Professor Farnsworth	Correct! This box contains our own universe.
	Hermes	Sweet honey bee of infinity!
	Leela	Bender! Quit destroying the universe!
	Bender	But--
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box. And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives.
