	Galactic Entity	A wise man once said that nothing really dies. It just comes back in a new form. Then he died. So, next time you see a lowly salamander, think twice before you step on it. It might be you. Stand by for "Reincarnation".
	Planet Express headquarters	'Owdy, folks! Come on in!
	Leela	[singing] Jumpin' Joe an' golly jeeper,I got one gigantic peeper.Sassafras an' banana oil,I'm a bee-youtiful purple-haired goyl.
	Bender	Watch it!
	Fry	Oh, it's just that I love Leela something awful. Do you think a space-age dame like her would ever marry a two-bit, low-life delivery boy like me an' also I 'ave bad posture and severe financial problems?
	Bender	Have you tried gettin' 'er pregnant?
	Fry	Gosh, yes. I've tried an' tried, but, so far, I only got Amy pregnant.
	Bender	You know what your problem is? [He pushes his antenna down and a cigar suddenly appears in his mouth.] Too much smoke in your face.
	Fry	I wanna ask Leela to marry me, but I can't afford a diamond ring big enough to express my love.
	Bender	That's for sure. [Bender stretches his arm out and takes Fry's wallet from his pants pocket.] Not on the measly salary I steal from you each month.
	Horn loudspeaker	All crew, report to the laboratorium. Get a wiggle on.
	Fry	Thanks for the heads-up, Sparky.
	Horn loudspeaker	Mhm. Fish on Friday. An' Human flesh the rest of the week.
	Professor Farnsworth	Movietone News, everyone. [He steps away from the telescope.] I've discovered a new comet!
	Leela	One side, boys. Let a lady take a gander.
	Professor Farnsworth	Hang on. Let me just adjust it to your eye level.
	Leela	[off camera] Holy matrimony! [on camera] That's one flashy rock!
	Professor Farnsworth	Indeed. It's pure diamondium!
	Fry	Um... Would it be possible to break off a piece an' put it in an engagement ring for reasons that are private?
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, fuff! Nothing in the universe can fracture diamondium. Not even God 1 an' God 2 put together. But behold! [He takes out a large can from his lab coat. Close up on the can, which is labeled "HOLOGRAM in SAUCE". Farnsworth opens it with an old fashioned can opener. The can opens and pours out a hologram of the comet.] The tail is composed of abrasive comet powder. [He throws away the can.] And that's just what I need to put a washday shine on my new Doomsday device. [He suddenly picks up a very large doomday device with a skull and crossbones on it. Wide shot of the laboratorium. Nibbler is suddenly seen in baby clothes crawling on the widow's walk.] Now hop in the flivver and score me some o' that sweet, sweet powder.
	Hermes	Comet ahoy! [off camera] Why, it's lit up like a smooth, refreshing Chesterfield.
	Professor Farnsworth	Get plenty of that powder. I want this bomb to sparkle like the floor at Grand Central Station. [He pulls a chain. A toilet can be heard flushing. He gets out of the radio carrying the Doomsday device, and it is in fact an outhouse.] Over and out.
	Amy	Watch it, ya stumblebums! You're boopin' my betty!
	Fry	Um... I'll be back in a jiff. I gotta go check this comet for anarchists.
	Fry	Wouldja look at that gem! Slap that shiner on a ring an' me an' Leela will be doing the married, horizontal Charleston in no time.
	Fry	Alright, diamond. You won those rounds. But I've got an ace up my hole.
	Leela	I love this time of day. There's such a beautiful stillness.
	Fry	Leela, I don't know if words can describe how I feel about you—
	Leela	Good?
	Fry	Huh. I guess they can. Anyhow, when a guy feels good about 'is sweetheart, 'e wants to prove it by giving 'er somethin' really... Good!
	Leela	I'm still listenin', you big lug.
	Fry	What I'm tryin' to say is... In all the world, I couldn't find a diamond good enough for you. But then I found one out there... [Wide shot of the sky above New New York. The comet is floating above the sun.] Among the stars. The beautiful, affordable stars.
	Leela	You mean... When you disappeared up on the comet...
	Fry	Exactly.
	Leela	I thought you snuck off to take a dump.
	Fry	A man can sneak off to do two things.
	Leela	Oh, Fry!
	Fry	In exactly ten seconds, the Doomsday device will blow the stone loose. An', if my calculations are correct, it will land here on your finger.
	Leela's finger	You've made me the happiest finger in the whole wide hand!
	Fry	Comet kaboomination in three, two—
	Bird	Uh... Hello?! Cuckoo!
	Fry	The diamond still didn't break! [Fry sniffles.] [sad] Now, you'll never know 'ow much I love you. [Another explosion is heard, and gets the attention of Fry and Leela, who gasp. Close up on the comet, which breaks in half. One half begins to float towards the sun.] [continued, off camera] It went kersplitters!
	Leela	Fry, I don't need a diamond. You've given me the most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen! All the colours of the spectrum!
	Fry	[angry] Not beautiful enough! A swell gal like you deserves better!
	Leela	[off camera] What's that?! [on camera] Is my eye playing trick on me?! [Fry gasps.] It's so beautiful! Fry, you've created a new colour! Totally different from any other colour or combination of colours.
	Fry	Shucks. It's still only half as beautiful as you. [The two halves then finally meet, causing the rainbow to shatter into miniature diamonds, which falls onto New New York like snow.] Whoa!
	Leela	Whoa! I wish this moment could last forever.
	Fry	Leela, my love, will you marry—
	Alien	[off camera] Bernilla, my love, [on camera] will you marry me?
	Bernilla	Blorg! Blorg! A thousand times blorg!
	Bender	Ba-da-ba-da-ba-dip-That's all you get, jerks!
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, multiplayers! After a lifetime of toil, I'm on the verge of solving all the mysteries of science!
	Bender	So we can leave early?
	Professor Farnsworth	Certainly not! [Bender, who has turned red, complains. #+%$! flashes in front of Bender's mouth.] Not until I demonstrate this new microscope lens, [off camera] made from the debris of that diamondium comet.
	Bender	Eh, Professor.
	Professor Farnsworth	[fed up, on camera] Yes, Bender?
	Bender	Boo! [Professor Farnsworth screams and drops the lens on the floor. The floor turns black. The lens turns white and is shattered in seven pieces. A skull appears above it and disappears as it ascends. Bender laughs.] [quickly] Okay. Too bad. Goodbye.
	Professor Farnsworth	You're not through with this level! I have another lens.
	Bender	[back to normal] Bite my 8-bit metal ass. [Bender turns to Hermes.] That's "Bite" with a Y.
	Hermes	Whatever you say, mon.
	Professor Farnsworth	Due to the lens' remarkable quark-lattice structure, [off camera] it should be capable of unthinkable magnification! [The lens rotates. Scruffy, Zoidberg, Fry, and Leela are also sitting at the conference table and are looking forward.] Come. [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] Follow me to the lab.
	Bender	Hey, I'm gonna try that! So long, meatbags! Son of a—
	Professor Farnsworth	Eh, let me just insert [off camera] lens in microscope. [on camera] There! Now, for the first time, we may be able to see the infinitesimal fabric of matter itself. [off camera] Laying bare the most fundamental laws of the universe!
	Leela	[sexfully] Hey, Fry. I know something you could lay bare.
	Fry	[angry] Leela! Shhh! I'm tryin' to listen to a physics lecture!
	Professor Farnsworth	[on camera] Now, to examine some matter. Any old matter will do.
	Hermes	[off camera] Mon, that's some cheap-ass matter! [on camera] What the hell is it?
	Professor Farnsworth	[off camera] Oh, [on camera] it's just a log I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea. Now, to penetrate its deepest mysteries.
	Leela	[sexfully] Hey, Fry.
	Fry	[angry] Leela! No means no!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, my! There's a frog on a bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!
	Leela	An' that's the ultimate secret of the universe?!
	Professor Farnsworth	Apparently so. Wait! There's a snail on the tail of the frog on the bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!
	Hermes	Dear Eliza!
	Professor Farnsworth	[off camera] The snail itself is composed of cells, molecules, atoms...
	Fry	Pfff! Those things don't rhyme!
	Professor Farnsworth	[on camera] Things only rhyme below ten to the minus five angstroms, you dope! [off camera] Now, ions an' pions, muons an' gluons, neutrinos, gravitinos... [on camera] We're closing in on the very smallest particles of matter! For the first time, we're about to observe the fundamental structure of the universe. [off camera] Such detail. [on camera] Such finely wrought intricate beauty!
	Leela	It's like staring into the face of God!
	Scruffy	It's a mirror into Scruffy's soul.
	Professor Farnsworth	This explains everything! Even the Big Bang that created the universe! All that's left is the mathematics! Put down h-bar, uh, carry the infinity, and— My-reka! There it is! The Grand Unified Theory! Reducing all the laws of nature to a single equation!
	Amy	Professor, you did it! You solved the problem that baffled Einstein an' drove Stephen Hawking to quit physics and become a cartoon voice actor!
	Stephen Hawking	I like physics, but I love cartoons.
	Professor Farnsworth	This is the greatest moment in scientific history! At last, there are no more questions left to answer!
	Stephen Hawking	Yay!
	Amy	Yay!
	Hermes	Woohoo! Alright! Well done, Professor. Okay. Back to work, everyone.
	Professor Farnsworth	Wait. There are no more questions left to answer.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh.
	Morbo	And those are today's high scores. Linda?
	Linda	Thanks, Morbo. Coming up next, Galaxians. What you need to know to protect your family.
	Professor Farnsworth	How do you people do it? How do you go on knowing there's nothing more to know?!
	Fry	I watch TV. It's the next best thing to bein' alive.
	Professor Farnsworth	What's the use? I'm just not capable of the happiness of the dumb. If only I'd made some mistake!
	Stephen Hawking	You didn't. I checked the invariance of your Lagrangian. Hubba-hubba.
	Professor Farnsworth	Then there's nothing left to do! Nothing!
	Bender	Would it cheer you up if I punched Fry in the groin? 'Cause I'll do it. Regardless. Body blow! Body blow!
	Professor Farnsworth	I devoted every waking minute to answering the fundamental questions of science.
	Professor Farnsworth	[off camera] I never married.
	Professor Farnsworth	[off camera] Rarely went outside!
	Professor Farnsworth	[on camera] And, now that I've found all the answers, I realise that what I was living for were the questions!
	Fry	That stinks, Professor. Too bad the universe made it turn out that way and not some other way. I wonder why it did that.
	Stephen Hawking	Probably magnets.
	Professor Farnsworth	Shut up, Hawking. Fry, you idiot! [happy] You're a genius! Why are the laws of physics what they are? Instead of some other laws? To find out, we'd have to recreate the conditions before the Big Bang. It would take decades of work by thousands of scientists in a particle accelerator powered by dump trucks of flaming grant money. [back to normal] Of course, there'd be no guarantee of success. [sad] And, in any case, I'd never live to see it.
	Leela	I'm surprised you lived through that sentence.
	Hermes	Sorry you wasted your life, Professor. I guess you never know everything after all.
	Professor Farnsworth	Indeed. The pursuit of knowledge is hopeless and eternal. [happy, screaming] Hooray!
	Amy	[happy, screaming] Yay!
	Hermes	[happy, screaming] Yeah-heah!
	Bender	[happy, screaming] Woohoo! Alright! Yay!
	Professor Farnsworth	[back to normal, voiced by David Herman] Action Delivery Force, assemble!
	Bender	[back to normal] And me, Mighty Merchandise Robot!
	Transition Announcer	[off camera] Meanwhile, on Space Planet 4, the Aliens who communicate by dancing...
	Transition Announcer	[continued, off camera] Were worshipping a giant comet.
	Subtitle	All hail great comet! Beloved mascot of popular shrimp crunch snack! Also God. Foreigners killed our God! Many words of disapproval!
	Leela	[back to normal] Team assembled! [Leela points at Professor Farnsworth.] What is that box, you old witch?
	Professor Farnsworth	Ha ha ha! I'll never tell you. [Professor Farnsworth has stood up.] It's a deep space-emotion detector. [Strips showing the faces of Leela, Fry, Hermes, Zoidberg, Amy, and Bender appear on the screen as they gasp. In the machine, the heart stops beating.] The detector can tell you're impressed. You should be! [In the machine, the parabolic antenna whirls around and points up, the heart begins beating very fast, and the screen shows a green graph. An alarm goes off as the graph turns red.] Wha? The marvellous device. It's detecting a massive burst of anger. From deep space!
	Subtitle	There is Earth! Attack it as previously discussed!
	Fry	Flying bananas? Ha ha! I will slice them on my morning fish porridge.
	Professor Farnsworth	This is no time for one of your jokes, Fry.
	Fry	I will tell you something that's no joke. [Fry stands up and puts on a helmet.] I will lead the defence fight.
	Professor Farnsworth	Ha ha ha ha! Don't make me laugh. If we fight, we'll surely be destroyed.
	Hermes	Then what is our only hope?!
	Amy	We must summon Zagtar, defender of space!
	Hermes	You forget!
	Hermes	[off camera] Zagtar was destroyed by the crystal space devil!
	Leela	[off camera] The crystal space devil was once my brother, Prince Hiroshi.
	Leela	[on camera] I mourn his loss. But what matters now is protecting Earth from that fruit armada.
	Professor Farnsworth	I see your mother, the water Mutant, didn't raise any fools, Turanga Leela. Our only hope is to communicate with the Aliens. And show them our peaceful intentions.
	Bender	Perhaps they speak perfect English... As do we.
	Professor Farnsworth	We can't take that chance! We'll need my universal auto-translator!
	Professor Farnsworth	[off camera] This [on camera] is my universal auto-translator!
	Fry	That will show them our peaceful intentions.
	Professor Farnsworth	The only question is, "Who should [off camera] be our spokesman?!"
	Zoidberg	Me! Me! Choose Zoidberg.
	Fry	Zoidberg, a diplomat? The list of things I've heard now contains everything.
	Zoidberg	Hear my words. My shell may be tough like a samurai honeymoon mask, but inside I'm as soft and sensitive as a girl made of custard!
	Cubert	[happy] Custard time?! [screaming] Hooray!
	Zoidberg	Please! I am certain I will succeed with my delicate manner. Oops.
	Leela	Instead, I will send the peace transmission. Most honoured visitors, we greet you in peace.
	Subtitle	Why does it flap its face hole? I am puzzled, for we don't know what mouths are. It's a threat! Destruct them!
	Hattie	Kajigeru desu!
	Professor Farnsworth	All attempts to communicate with the Aliens have failed. I fear our only option is thrilling space battle.
	Bender;Fry	Power friends, go!
	Male voice	Launch all missiles! Launch all missiles!
	Professor Farnsworth	We were defeated in battle.
	Bender	[off camera] Oh, no! They're forming Gigatron!
	Professor Farnsworth	Defeat is ours. If we can't communicate with these bone-jelly ghosts, we're doomed!
	Amy	Professor, I 'ave analysed the Aliens' movements with this movement analyser.
	Professor Farnsworth	That device was a gift from my ancestors. Go on.
	Amy	It seems their movements are a form of language. Rather than speaking Ja—
	Transition Announcer	English!
	Amy	[continued] Like us, they speak by dancing.
	Professor Farnsworth	Of course! Having no mouths our ears, they could only communicate through motions!
	Fry	Or perhaps by odours!
	Bender	That is 'ow you communicate!
	Amy;Leela;Fry;Bender;Hermes	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
	Leela	Then our only hope to talk to them is by doing a peace dance. But it will have to be smoother an' more fluid than any movement mankind is capable of.
	Fry	What if we hire a buttered geisha?
	Professor Farnsworth	Another one of your ill-timed jokes, Fry?!
	Fry	You an' I are enemies now!
	Zoidberg	Hear my words. I believe I, the most humble member of Action Delivery Team, could do such a dance!
	Hermes	Surely, your heart shell is too rigid! I call on anyone but you to do the peace dance!
	Zoidberg	[sad] Aw.
	Bender	Of course, I will do the peace dance. But I will need 'elp.
	Bender;Fry	Super Dance Squad, initiate!
	Amy	We all hope they're communicating a peaceful message!
	Subtitle	Hey aliens, we will kill you! And dishonor your widows by making them gather wood! Fire a the weapon!
	Professor Farnsworth	Wha, wha?! We thought we were so smart with our science and dancing, but look at us now: At Gigatron's mercy!
	Zoidberg	The shame is too great. It's time to end this! Huh-yah! Feh!
	Leela	[off camera] Zoidberg, [on camera] stop! We are too scared right now to enjoy the ceremony of your death!
	Zoidberg	No hara-kiri today, but heiwa no dansu! The gelatinous dance of peace!
	Hermes	You may be gelatinous, but not even the Mochi Phanton could perform such intricate motions!
	Zoidberg	Says you, salaryman!
	Subtitle	What is the medical crab doing?
	Zoidberg	Behold! The dance of peace!
	Bender	The dance is so complex! The eye can barely follow it!
	Zoidberg	I may be the humblest Team member, but I have given it my all.
	Amy	I underestimated you, medical crab. But will the Aliens understand?!
	Subtitle	We have understand peace.
	Subtitle	Farewell, Action Team.
	Professor Farnsworth	Zoidberg, you are the greatest hero. You saved us all.
	Zoidberg	For now. But another threat from the stars is sure to arise next week at the same time!
	Leela	Until then...
	Bender;Fry	Action Delivery Force star-hero rocket engage!
