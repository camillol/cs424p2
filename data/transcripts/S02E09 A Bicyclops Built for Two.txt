	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through. Whee! We're online!
	Professor Farnsworth	Go ahead, get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.
	Leela	They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey.
	Professor Farnsworth	Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
	Fry	Hey!
	Bender	Behold: The Internet!
	Fry	My God! It's full of ads!
	Leela	Follow me!
	Fry	It's immense.
	Leela	It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
	Fry	So I see!
	Zoidberg	What? What's going on here?
	Amy	Hey, that's me!
	Bender	No, it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
	Leela	Hey!
	Doorman	Are you over 18?
	Young Boy	Yes.
	Younger Boy	Yes.
	Bender	I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.
	Amy	Ew, that is so gross!
	Leela	Yeah. I'll stick with this one, thank you.
	Amy	Yeah.
	Bender	[sexfully] Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
	Man	Ooh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
	Bender	So how 'bout them Knicks?
	Nerd #1	Hello? Are there any girls in this room at all?
	Nerd #2	Yeah, bring on the hot chicks 'cause I'm a hot stud.
	Nerd #3	Yeah! So are we!
	Leela	I'm a woman, if that's what you mean. [The nerds gasp.] I don't like to play games, so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man.
	Nerd #4	A woman! I'm scared.
	Fry	Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
	Bender	[sarcastic] Is the Space Pope reptilian?
	Hermes	Get ready for fun, Fry. Nowadays, we have a type of game played entirely on video.
	Leela	We call it a "video game".
	Fry	[sarcastic] Uh, "video game" you say? Well, golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works.
	Zoidberg	The doctor is in! [Fry does a somersault and shoots at Zoidberg. He fizzles.] The doctor is out!
	Holo-Farnsworth	Everyone, please sign off. We have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone-- [Bender shatters him and laughs. Leela jumps across a gap and runs up a wall, leaps from it and starts kicking Bender in the head. Farnsworth's head appears again.] Leela, please tell the others that--
	Leela	Who are you?
	Cyclops	I saw you in the chat room but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After all these years of searching for another Cyclops.
	Leela	I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
	Cyclops	Do you think perhaps you and I--
	Leela	Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am!
	Fry	Oh, Leela, I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do-- [He jumps out and shoots Leela.] Gotcha! [She shatters. Fry jumps up and down cheering.] I won! I'm the greatest!
	Leela	Come on. We have work to do.
	Fry	Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
	Leela	No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now let's concentrate on getting this desperately-needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14, OK?
	Operator	[voice-over; on screen] Leela, you've got mail! [Leela sighs.] It's not spam.
	Leela	Huh? [She opens the email. The Cyclops appears on the screen.] It's him!
	Cyclops	[on screen] To Leela. Subject: Hello. I am Alcazar. Fortunately I wrote down your screenname before I was dispatched by that oafish moron.
	Fry	Kicked your ass!
	Alcazar	[on screen] Leela, we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow.
	Fry	Well, too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
	Leela	It'll get there.
	Leela	After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong.
	Bender	Too bad it's a dump.
	Leela	Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
	Fry	Lazy sculptor!
	Alcazar	Welcome home, Leela.
	Leela	Alcazar? [He leaps off the balcony and stands in front of her.] Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
	Alcazar	Ow! Of course I'm real.
	Leela	After all this time, somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun.
	Alcazar	It's alright, Leela. You'll never be alone again. [He claps his hand and two lizards run out through an arch, pulling a carriage behind them.] Come, let me introduce you to yourself. Do you mind if your servants walk?
	Leela	Not at all!
	Alcazar	We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is the capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you.
	Leela	There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
	Alcazar	This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
	Fry	Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?
	Alcazar	Her perfect eye reminds me of yours, Leela. Had our race survived, you would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel.
	Leela	Oh, please! Really?
	Alcazar	And there's the infamous pirate, Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas.
	Fry	What's over that hill?
	Alcazar	The Forbidden Valley. A holy sanctuary where no one may tread.
	Fry	Is that anything like a cemetery 'cause I gotta take a leak. [Leela slaps him.] Ow!
	Leela	Fry, that's offensive to our people. [She turns to Alcazar.] Isn't it?
	Fry	Ow!
	Alcazar	This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.
	Leela	Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.
	Bender	Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room.
	Alcazar	In here is where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.
	Leela	It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
	Alcazar	It's too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters.
	Bender	Ow! Ow! Ow!
	Leela	I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
	Alcazar	Nothing. It's just-- No, Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye.
	Leela	Please, is it about the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that.
	Alcazar	Well, OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go into my chamber.
	Alcazar	[voice-over] It wasn't long ago. Our people were happy and prosperous ... [The flashback cuts to a dark planet with rocky terrain and lots of large molehills.] ... but the eyeless mole people of Subterra 3 grew jealous of our visual prowess. They fired missile in all directions hoping to hit Cyclopia. [A mole man presses a button and several hundred missiles are launched from the planet.] Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets hit, was ours.
	Cyclopian Man #1	How far away do you think it is?
	Cyclopian Man #2	A trillion miles?
	Alcazar	Things got hot. You look a little hot, actually. You can take off that jacket. [Leela takes her jacket off.] Our people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact...
	Alcazar	[voice-over] Our smartest scientists managed to save one baby.
	Leela	Alcazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!
	Alcazar	[voice-over] Fortunately, I was employed as a pool cleaner at the time and, when I emerged from retrieving a dead possum, I found I was the only one left.
	Leela	It's so tragic.
	Alcazar	Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us.
	Leela	It doesn't have to.
	Alcazar	What do you mean?
	Leela	You're a male and I'm a female.
	Alcazar	I'm still not following you.
	Leela	Wake up, my king.
	Alcazar	Oh, jeez, what a night. Make me some coffee, would you.
	Leela	Uh, sure, OK. What do you take with that?
	Alcazar	Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic.
	Leela	Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
	Fry	Mmm! Great pancakes, Leela.
	Alcazar	Yeah, they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes. [He chuckles. Bender laughs loudly, scrapes his pancake onto the floor and slips the plate into his chest cabinet. Alcazar turns to Leela.] Listen, hon', we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species, do we?
	Leela	No.
	Alcazar	So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity photos by name and what you can see.
	Leela	Look, Alcazar--
	Alcazar	Call me Al.
	Leela	Look, Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise, but I'm not your maid.
	Alcazar	You're right, I'm sorry. I guess the relationship isn't going to work. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but, uh--
	Leela	OK, OK, I'll do the dishes. [She looks at the table but it has been cleared.] Hey, where'd they go?
	Bender	Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some low-life jerk.
	Fry	He may be some low-life jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
	Fry	Try and stop me!
	Leela	Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it. [She sits down next to him.] Who are these people?
	Alcazar	Friends.
	Leela	Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?
	Alcazar	They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you, Leela!
	Leela	Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear.
	Rat Woman	You go, girl!
	Alcazar	By the way, your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Take him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place.
	Leela	Come on, Al, can't you let the little guy out?
	Alcazar	Jeez, Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!
	Leela	Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
	Fry	'Cause I think Alcazar's hiding something from you. Listen, Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you. He--
	Leela	I know.
	Fry	You do?
	Leela	Fry, if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me. He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
	Fry	Then dump his one-eyed ass.
	Leela	I can't. If I leave Alcazar, that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness.
	Alcazar	[from bathroom] Leela! Mop up in aisle number two!
	Leela	I'll break up with him at dinner.
	Fry	I'll be there.
	Alcazar	Yo, Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap.
	Pig	Yeah. Like crap.
	Fry	C'mon, Leela, you deserve better than this guy. Dump him already!
	Leela	I'm trying.
	Alcazar	Hey, everyone, jam a sock in your spit faucets. [Everyone stops eating and looks up.] Not long ago I spent my lonely nights renting slasher flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman arrived and-- Stop eating, Pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question. [He walks around the table to Leela and goes down on one knee.] Leela, will you marry me?
	Fry	[whispering] No! No!
	Leela	Yes! I will!
	Rat Woman	They're getting married!
	Amy	Congratulations, Leela!
	Zoidberg	Hello.
	Hermes	Oh, this is great!
	Leela	[shaking hands] Glad you could make it.
	Bender	[shaking hands] It's a magical day.
	Fry	[shaking hands] Welcome!
	Fry	Psst, Leela. You've gotta get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.
	Leela	Animals go in the corner.
	Fry	The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
	Leela	Look, Fry, I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy. [She hands him a bottle.] Here. Try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.
	Fry	That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
	Fry	Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
	Bender	Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.
	Fry	But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
	Bender	I don't know, Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.
	Fry	Bender, snap out of it!
	Bender	Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go. [He slings his sack of swag over his shoulder.] [singing] I love stealing, I love taking things!
	Zoidberg	[crying] That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.
	Fry	Come on, boy, jump! [The lizards crash through the gate.] Good boy!
	Bender	Whoa, Mittens!
	Fry	My God! Four identical castles!
	Bender	Each more identical than the last!
	Fry	That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.
	Bender	And here's another one with no eyes.
	Preacherbot	Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?
	Professor Farnsworth	Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
	Alcazar	Cut to the chase, Preach!
	Preacherbot	Do you, Alcazar ... [Alcazar fast-forwards the Preacherbot.] ... [fast] take this woman before you ... to love ... in sickness ... do you part?
	Alcazar	Yeah, sure I do. Come on, faster!
	Preacherbot	Do you, Leela, copy and paste his response till death do you part?
	Leela	I ... d--
	Amy	Oh, my God!
	Alcazar	What the--?
	Fry	Hey, Alcazar, you left somebody off the guest list.
	Five-Eyed Woman	Alcazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?
	Alcazar	It ... ooh, uh! [He grows four more eyes.] Hey, sweetie. Just go back to the castle and wait for me. [He turns to Leela and returns to his one eye.] She-- She's nuts. I can morph into a five-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you.
	Fry	Oh, yeah? Then what about this?
	Alcazar	This is a bit awkward.
	Five-Eyed Woman	Who's she?
	Leela	Who's she?
	Sandy	Who are they?
	Alcazar	Go back to the castle, Sandy.
	Fry	And maybe you'd like to meet her. [A purple alien comes in.] And her.
	Alcazar	Leela, this must all be very confusing.
	Leela	A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
	Sandy	Show us your real form!
	Leela	Yeah!
	Alien #2	Do it!
	Alcazar	Well, this is the real me. But I can explain: We all have needs. Mine was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two-way mirror. Can any of you say you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?
	Bender	[crying] He's a saint!
	Leela	But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
	Alcazar	Hey, lady, you got any idea what it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?
	Leela	Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you.
	Alcazar	What's that?
	Leela	If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?
	Leela	Thanks for saving me from that creep, Fry.
	Fry	Hey, that's what I do.
	Leela	I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was.
	Professor Farnsworth	No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home.
	Leela	Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?
