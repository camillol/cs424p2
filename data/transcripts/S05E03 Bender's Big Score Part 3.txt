	Bender	Preparing to terminate Philip Fry.
	Schlump	What's with the doofy sun glasses?
	Bender	It's really bright in the past.
	Bender	[crying] Mission accomplished.
	Schlump	Fry is dead?
	Bender	No other robot could have done it. It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend. [cries] I'm the greatest.
	Head cleaner	Time code and obedience virus erased.
	Bender	Huh?
	Head cleaner	Also, fifty terabytes of porn.
	Bender	Hey!
	Nudar	You've got no porn, no code, and you're ugly! Let's dance!
	Leela	Now it's true we'll all miss Fry.
	Zoidberg	He was the only one of you who never struck me.
	Leela	And we'll never see if boyish smile and hair horn again. But I bet he went back to his own time. I'm sure he was very happy and lived to a ripe old age.
	Bender	He wasn't and he didn't!
	Bender	Struggling alone again incredible odds, I, Bender, managed to kill him. [cries] I blew him to mush like a midget in a microwave. [cries]
	Amy	Awww, don't blame yourself, Bender.
	Bender	I don't blame myself, I blame all of you.
	Amy	Us?! How can you possibly blame us?
	Bender	It ain't easy. It just proves how great I am. [breaks down and cries] Ohhh, Fry, I'd give anything to unmurder you!
	Fry	Did someone call me?
	Bender	No. [gasps] Fry? [runs to Fry] But ... I killed you in 2012. Unless ...
	Fry	Ooph!
	Bender	Nope, he's not a zombie.
	Lars	Welcome back Fry.
	Fry	[sarcastic] Thank you, Lars.
	Lars	[to Leela] I .. ah ... I .. I'll see you later, honey.
	Professor Farnsworth	So tell us Fry, If Bender killed you centuries ago, how in Satan's glorious name did you return?
	Fry	Ohh, it's an astonishing tale of incredibleness. It all began when I went back in time.
	Professor Farnsworth	Duhhh.
	Fry	Hey, Mr. Panucci, I'm back from that delivery to the cryogenic lab.
	Mr. Panucci	Great. I'll put you on the cover of Big Whoop magazine!
	Fry	Mmmm, I'm starving. Can I have a slice?
	Mr. Panucci	Help yourself. Cash up front.
	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	This note is legal tender.
	Fry	(VO) Unfortunately, I had no money from that era. But that's when it hit me - I knew where to find free pizza.
	Fry	[groans] Ohh, ice cold.
	Fry	(VO) That's when it hit me again ...
	Fry	But an hour ago this pizza's still luke warm. [unzips pants and reads time code off his ass] Zero zero one one zero ...
	Bender-2	(OC) [monotone] Explosion in seven, six ...
	Fry-2	It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.
	Bender-2	[monotone] five .. [normal] Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!
	Fry	Nice kick, me.
	Fry-2	Thanks. What are you doing here?
	Fry	One hour from now, I travel back in time for free pizza.
	Fry-2	But Nibbler said not to use the time code.
	Fry	Fine, Mr. Responsible, don't use the code. Mmmmm. That pizza sure was good.
	Fry-2	You pig.
	Fry	Whatever.
	Fry	(VO) That's when it hit me yet a third time ...
	Fry	[slaps himself on the forehead] You idiot, frozen me's still got a wallet full of old timey money.
	Fry	Yuck, I touched my own butt.
	Fry	So I unfroze ten minutes ago and I walked over here and then it was now and then I don't know what happened.
	Bender	Well, I'm glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I'm incompetent so I better kill you again. Hold still.
	Professor Farnsworth	Bender! Stop killing for a minute. The Fry you murdered was doomed anyway. See?
	Bender	What'd ya got there? Numbers?
	Professor Farnsworth	When the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed. And that includes flabby Jamaican potbellies.
	Hermes	Kiss my front butt.
	Fry	So my copy lives twelve years before Bender murdered him?
	Bender	Brutally murdered.
	Fry	I wonder what his life was like?
	Scruffy	I guess we'll never know.
	Zoidberg	Or will we?
	Scruffy	Nope.
	Transition Announcer	They won't know, but you will. Lucky you.
	Fry-2	Oh hey Mr. Panucci, I'm back from the delivery to the cryogenic lab.
	Mr. Panucci	I know. I read about it in Big Whoop magazine.
	Fry-2	So ... uh ... my girlfriend kicked me out. Can I rent the upstairs storage room?
	Mr. Panucci	The upstairs storage? [Laughs] I like you kid. Your lousy life makes me feel good about myself. The room's yours. Here, take some rat spray for the meat ball hamper.
	Hermes	Happy day, mon! It's good to have you back.
	Nibbler	Indeed, but the scammers will soon sprunje the code again. We must remove the time tattoo at once, and as painlessly as possible.
	Lars	Hurry, they're coming.
	Nibbler	There, the code is gone. I saved the space-time continuum and forty percent of your rectum.
	Bubblegum	That's all you need.
	Nudar	I sprunje code.
	Nibbler	Too late, Nudar. I've wiped Fry's butt clean.
	Nudar	[sniffing] We'll see about that.
	Fleb	Nothing boss. We sprunjed his ass inside and out.
	Schlump	The only information we found was a hair shaped like the number six.
	Nudar	[taking hair] Give me that. [eats hair] mmm. Nine. Alright, let him go, I guess the time code really is gone.
	Fry	Thank god. The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday.
	Fry-2	I'm sorry Leela, I can't keep living in the past, by which I mean the future. I'll always love you, but I've got to move on and find my life's purpose.
	TV Anchorman	... and that how Bundles the monkey finally found a friend.
	Fry-2	I miss Morbo.
	TV Anchorman	And finally tonight on the late, cute animal news, a story that will really tug your heartstrings, way more than bundles, the doll-raping monkey. It's the tale of lonely Leelu, the little orphan narwhal.
	Fry-2	Awww.
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	(on TV) Leelu is a rare, toothed female narwhal who got disoriented and washed up in Atlantic City, as we all do from time to time. But without a mother, she's lost the will to eat. [offering bottle to Leelu] Come on, take a sip.
	Fry-2	I know how to make things eat. Maybe this is my purpose in life.
	Fry	Hi, I'd like to apply for a job working with Leelu.
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	Question number one, do you have any experience working with marine mammals?
	Fry-2	No, but I think they're pretty neat.
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	That answers question number two. Question number three, do you know where the door is or would you prefer to be kicked out?
	Fry-2	I don't know. I guess kicked out.
	Fry-2	Hiya girl. My name's Fry, and I think you're a cutie 'cause I like things that have only one thing instead of two things.
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	Holy mackerel, she's eating whole mackerel. I don't know what your secret is but if you'll work for minimum wage you can start tomorrow.
	Fry-2	If I work of less than minimum, can I start today?
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	I don't see why not.
	Morbo	(on TV) In business news, the weak and gullible inhabitants of Earth were plunged into economic depression today as the scammer aliens finished stealing every item of value, including ownership of this station.
	Linda	(on TV) [laughs]
	Nudar	Tough times earth chumps. We're repossessing your TV. Seems you can't afford it now that you're unemployed.
	Zoidberg	We're not unemplo --
	Lars	I love the hard museum at night. It's where I come to be alone.
	Heads	Hi Lars.
	De Gaulle	Ah, Lars and la belle Leela. I trust you brought some haute cuisine for an old Frenchman.
	Lars	You're favorite General, Torgo's Executive Powder.
	De Gaulle	Mmmm. Magnifique.
	Lars	Come on Leela, let me show you the hall of screaming skulls.
	Leela	It's so romantic. [turns away from Lars and cries]
	Lars	What's wrong? Is the screaming depressing you?
	Leela	It's just ... my life is changing so fast. I don't know who I am anymore.
	Lars	I know who you are. You're the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
	Leela	Let's go to my place.
	Lars	I ... like what you've done with it.
	Leela	[reading from a sign on the fence] "All tenants evicted, signed new owners"?
	Nudar	That would be us, dump cakes. We're buying the whole city and turning it into a private panda hunting reserve. Na-na-na!!
	Leela	There aren't any Pandas in New New York.
	Schlump	Back it up, Sal!
	Amy	Look at us, living like trash eating bums in an alley now.
	Zoidberg	Yes. Now.
	Tinny Tim	And on Xmas eve, the most wonderful night of the [Bender trips him] ooofff.
	Bender	Oops.
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, at least we have each other, so it truly is the worst Xmas ever.
	Hermes	[pointing] Santa!
		Ah, the Planet Express crew. According to my list [Bender mimicking] you've all been very naughty. I'll be back for you after I collect my milk and cookies from starving orphans.
	Fry	That's it. I don't see how things could get any worse.
	Bender	We could sing.
	Professor Farnsworth	I'd rather kill myself.
	Amy	Why not do both?
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, very well.
	Nudar	[off camera] Neh!
	Leela	[singing] Lars brought me candy.
	Fry;Amy;Zoidberg;Bender;Tinny Tim;Nibbler	[singing] Cram it down and shut the hell up!
	Hermes	[singing] I can't compete with that.
	Leela	[singing] Lars says I'm dreamy.
	Fry;Zoidberg;Amy;Tinny Tim;Bender;Farnsworth	[singing] Who the hell cares?
	Santa	[at head of alley holding weapons] That's my cue.
	Tinny Tim	Oh my word!
	Leela	Hey, guess what guys!
	Zoidberg	What?
	Zoidberg	[singing] Mazel tov!
	Amy	[singing] May stars in heaven bless your love!
	Fry	Now could things get any worse.
	Santa	Ho! Ho! Ho.
	Lars	Stop screaming. That's just what the bomb wants us to do.
	Zoidberg	I say do what it tells us. [screams and clacks claws]
	Lars	Don't worry, a bomb in a case is just like a head in a jar.
	Leela	[hugging Lars] Oh Lars! No blowing us up make me love you even more.
	Fry	[grumbling] Life saving goody goody ...
	Professor Farnsworth	Well now that death has been staved off momentarily, let me be the first to say congratulations Leela and Lars.
	Amy	[raising hand] Maid of honor!
	Zoidberg	[raising claw an instant later] Maid of honor! Ohhh.
	Fry	[quietly] I could make you happy too, if only you'd give me a chance.
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	You've done a wonderful job, Fry. When you first started, I thought she'd be dead within a narweek, which is six days I believe.
	Fry-2	Nah. Leelu's a champ. She just needed someone to show her how to eat. [Fry-2 tosses a fish into his mouth, and another into Leelu's mouth]
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	Now that the kind of whale behavioral science they don't teach you in whale behavioral science class.
	Fry	So what's up, Dr. Schlovinowitz?
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	[sighs] This is a little hard for me to say Fry. You see, it's ... it's time we released Leelu back into the wild.
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	I'm sorry. The decision is final. Plus we need the tank for the Loch Ness monster.
	Fry-2	But that turned out to be a log with a Halloween mask stapled to it.
	Dr. Schlovinowitz	Yes, well, it still draws a crowd.
	Fry-2	[crying] I can't let this happen, she'll never be happy without me.
	Elzar	I know you're broke and homeless but you still want a swank wedding reception so I whipped you up some real nice budge appetizers.
	Lars	[tasting one] Mmmm. I can keep these down.
	Elzar	Okay! That's a big "yes" on the crud puffs. Try the shlimp cocktail.
	Fry	There must be some way I can stop this wedding. What if I steal the wedding ring?
	Bender	Already taken care of. [Bender displays a diamond ring on his finger]
	Fry	You think that'll be enough to stop the ceremony.
	Bender	Nope. I pulled the old switcheroo, so they won't even know the difference. Wait a minute, I think the copy I made cost more than this.
	Fry	Cheap lousy Lars.
	Bender	[examining the ring through a jeweler's loupe] Actually this is extremely nice, but I really went all out on the copy. It was sorta my gift to them.
	Fry	I can't let this happen. She'll never be happy without me.
	Fry-2	It's not fair, we need each other.
	Mr. Panucci	Fry, you dumb sack, I don't care about your problems at all! [coughs]
	Fry-2	You need your blanket Mr. Panucci.
	Mr. Panucci	I don't even want to be here. I only came 'cause you wheeled me. But if that narwal means so much to you, you gotta do something.
	Fry-2	I know. But I can't just go chasing after her. That'd be nuts.
	Mr. Panucci	Ah, Sometimes you gotta be a little nuts. Let me introduce you to my cousin. He owns a small freighter. That's him, right behind us.
	Fry-2	[to Panucci] Maybe you're right. [to Panucci's cousin] Sir, I'd like to engage your ship for a trans-Arctic voyage to capture a Narwhal and bring it back to my room.
	Mr. Panucci	The mans is nuts, Leroy.
	Leroy	Professional whale keeper, eh? I've carried your type before and we don't get along. Oh, I agree with your values and your goals and your methods, but somehow we just never click on a personal level.
	Fry-2	I'm not a professional anymore. Just a narwal loving private citizen.
	Leroy	Then I'm you man. We'll take on three barrels of fresh sausage and sail at dawn.
	Terry	[dramatically] Welcome to the wedding.
	Fry	[to Bender] It's a fool proof plan. They can't sign the wedding license if I give them a pen with no ink. [laughs and exchanges pens]
	Bender	Yeah, once they try to sign that license, all hell will break look. [rolls eyes up, muttering] Oy vey.
	LaBarbara	Go on now, mon, don' cha' know nothin' about zippin' up a woman's frock?
	Slim	[struggling with the zipper on LaBarbara's dress] It's more my thing to zip 'em down. [laughs]
	Hermes	Get your clumsy, muscular hands off my woman, Barbados.
	LaBarbara	Hermes! Your body!
	Slim	I always said you were a little backward.
	Hermes	Well, I always said you were a little forward ... with my wife.
	Bystanders	ohhh!
	Hermes	[zips up LaBarbara frock] Consider yourself bird dogged.
	LaBarbara	That's my man. Take a boat, Barbados.
	Bubblegum	Brother, you gots to tell that sweet thing your time duplicate body is doomed.
	Hermes	Tomorrow morning. After the "festivities".
	Bubblegum	[nudging Hermes and spinning a basketball on his finger] Yow, baby!
	Turanga Munda	[from a grating beneath the asile] Our little girl is finally getting married. And to a normal two eyed human.
	Turanga Morris	Eh, he's not good enough for her. Leela deserves a guy with a dozen eyes.
	Turanga Munda	Quit trying to fix her up with Fly Mutant. [A humanoid with large fly eyes behind them buzzes and licks fluid off one eye]
	Father Changstein-el-Gamahl	Dearly liked, we are gathered here before one or more gods, or fewer, to joining this couple in pretty good matrimony. If anyone objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their piece, or do something else.
	Leroy	It's been two years, Fry. We've caught a hundred and eight narwhals and set them all free again.
	Fry-2	None of them were Leelu.
	Inuit #1	But all of them were edible.
	Inuit #2	[pointing] Can we at least eat that one? I'm sick of sausage.
	Fry-2	[looking through binoculars, gasps] I'd know that modified extended tooth anywhere. To the boats!
	Fry-2	Leelu! Leelu! It's me, Fry.
	Fry-2	[hugging Leelu] Oh, I've missed you too, Leelu. But we'll never be apart again because we care too much for each other. Fire!
	Father Changstein-el-Gamahl	Now, if the couple will sign the wedding license.
	Professor Farnsworth	I warned him. I warned him a time paradox duplicate is always doomed.
	Lars	[surprised] What?
	LaBarbara	Oh, no, my man! He's essentially dead again.
	Dr. Cahill	Relax ma'am. Your husband's original body will be repaired within one week.
	LaBarbara	Nah uh uh. Not soon enough. Boy needs a daddy.
	Slim	Cruel runnings, mon. [laughs]
	Dr. Cahill	Woopsy-doopsy, poopsy.
	Hermes	Well, let's get on with it. Don't let my doomed body and my doomed marriage stand in the way of your happiness.
	Lars	No, it's not right. We don't want our happy day tainted by misfortune and tragedy, do we?
	Leela	I'm OK with it.
	Lars	No, it's not right. The wedding is off.
	Bender	Oh my goodness! [starts stealing the wedding gifts]
	Fry	[snickering] Finally, a happy ending.
