	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Look! Up in the sky!
	Hermes	It's a bird!
	Hattie McDoogal	It's a plane!
	Super Hero	I am so out of here! [He flies off screen.]
	Zapp	Captain's log, star date, the year of the tiger. The battle has been bravely fought, and the suffering of our troops beyond measure. But the alien is invulnerable, and our defeat inevitable. That much is obvious, even from my remote command post here at the Times Square Applebee's. [Cut to a shot of Zapp sitting in a booth next to a window controlling the Nimbus with a joystick. The anomaly and tentacles can be seen through the window to his left.] Waiter! Take this fried mozzarella back to the kitchen and fry it some more.
	Richard Nixon	Har-harrooo! The tentacle's coming towards Earth and there's no stopping it. King Kong's too old to save us this time.
	Professor Farnsworth	We have only one hope, Mr. President. We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented, ultra-hard Diamondium!
	Wernstrom	Diamondium? (He scoffs.) I could gum through that with my dentures behind my back. My trademarked Diamondillium is twice as hard!
	Professor Farnsworth	Twice as hard as your head! Which makes it still fairly soft!
	Richard Nixon	Now look here, you Poindexters. I don't care how you decide. Just decide!
	Professor Farnsworth	Diamondillium it is.
	Bender	So, hey, Calculon, I know I'm the new guy, and, pardon my ignorance, but when do we kill all humans?
	Calculon	Never.
	Bender	But what about our motto? [A shot of a plaque above the fireplace that says "KILL ALL HUMANS!"] Doesn't it mean anything?
	Calculon	Oh, Bender, your idealism is heart-warming. But the League of Robots hasn't killed a human in over 800 years. And that was a very sick girl scout.
	British Robot	Quite sick indeed.
	Calculon	Sweet, innocent Bender. [He pats Bender on the head and flicks his antenna. Bender looks up at Calculon evilly.]
	Wernstrom	I declare my impenetrable Diamondillium sphere complete! [The crowd cheers and Wernstrom waves to them.]
	Professor Farnsworth	Now look here, Wernstrom. You're making it sound as if the sphere was your idea when we both know... [Shattering glass is heard and a tentacle is through the sphere.] It was! All credit to my colleague, Ogden Wernstrom!
	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	It's horrible!
	Zoidberg	I can't make it! Go on without me! [Pull back to reveal he's holding onto Leela's boot.]
	Leela	I'm trying! [She struggles to pull him, but slowly does.]
	Zoidberg	Go on without me faster!
	Hermes	Sweet squid of Madrid! The tentacle got Fry!
	Leela	Quick, hand me my machete! We can still save his legs!
	Fry	Silence! [The crowd goes quiet.] I have traveled far and seen deep, and I have come to know the purpose of our existence.
	Randy Munchnik	Finally.
	Fry	Thou shalt love the tentacle!
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, at least we don't have to love one another.
	Fry	A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle! [Tentacles enter into the crowd through the fire hydrants.] Open your necks and receive the love!
	Warden Vogel	Ow, my neck!
	Morgan Proctor	Ow, my neck!
	Fishy Joe	My neck feels perfectly... [A tentacle attaches to his neck.] Ow, my neck!
	Zoidberg	Hooray, Zoidberg escaped! [He is attacked by a tentacle.] Hooray, Zoidberg loves the tentacle! [He is pulled through the doggy door by the tentacle.]
	Hermes	It got Zoidberg!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out.
	Fry	Thus sayeth the tentacle, "Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle."
	Leela	Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed.
	Fry	No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. Please, let me speak. [A laser points at his forehead.]
	Leela	I'm listening.
	Fry	Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela. [He grabs part of the tentacle that is attached to him and pets it.] It's beautiful and it loves me. And I love it. [A second laser appears on his forehead and a cocking gun is heard.]
	Leela	Aw. That's so nice for both of you.
	Fry	I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by (quoting the syllables) "Hollywood." But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas. [He looks up at the anomaly. Leela slips off her boot and pulls out another gun to aim at Fry's forehead while he turned away. A third laser appears on his forehead.] Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing.
	Leela	[She pulls the guns away from him.] Really? It loves us that much? Fire Diamondium cannon!
	Fry	Hey! [He yelps as he's constantly swung out of harm's way.
	Leela	No effect. The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra.
	Wernstrom	Oh, what a surprise. I told you Diamondium was worthless!
	Professor Farnsworth	Wernstrom, quit hyping your cheap Diamondillium and look at this.
	Wernstrom	Uh-oh.
	Hermes	What oh?
	Professor Farnsworth	According to this blinking light, the tentacle is made of electro-matter, matter's bad-ass grandma! Nothing from our universe can cut through it. Not Diamondium, not Diamondillium, not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes! (To Wernstrom:) She's a terrible cook. (To All:) Anyway, we're all dead.
	Bender	[He sighs.] So, Bender, is something wrong? Who said that? Oh, it was me! 'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset!
	Fry	What, Bender? Is something wrong?
	Bender	Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, "leaguie-weegies."
	Fry	I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you. [A shot of Fry's back reveals the tentacle reaching from Fry's upper neck to lower spine in a very scar-like manner.] I've been kind of preoccupied.
	Bender	With what?
	Fry	Well, I went to another universe, and I fell in love with a giant octopus, and now I'm pope of a new religion.
	Bender	Weren't you already pope of something?
	Fry	[He puts on his Pope hat.] No.
	Bender	Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too.
	Fry	Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China. [He squeezes/yanks on the tentacle and is yanked through the window of the apartment and out into space.]
	Linda	They're coming! Those horrible, horrible things are coming! (Calm) Morbo?
	Morbo	As the universe falls prey to the revolting alien, only a few isolated pockets of resistance remain.
	Linda	Those pockets sure are missing out on a great thing.
	Leela	Amy?
	Amy	Sorry. I thought I saw a tentacle, but it was just a harmless land squid. [She points to a land squid as it squeals and shuffles back into a hole in the wall. She sighs as she walks over to the cocoffee machine.] I better have some cocoffee.
	Hermes	When I gave up diapers, my parents promised exactly this would never happen!
	Leela	Nobody panic! Just get to the panic room! [Amy, Hermes, Farnsworth and Wernstrom go through the door while Leela holds off the pursuing tentacles.]
	Fry	Well done, people! We had a great first week. We got 90% of world leaders, everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt, and this year's most promising new R&B group, give it up for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics!
	The Funkalistics	[They harmonize.] (singing) Talkin' 'bout the tentacle!
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! I was up all night inventing, and then finally, I invented!
	Amy	Invented what?
	Professor Farnsworth	[He holds up half of a toilet paper tube with an elastic attached to each side.] The neck protector, [He holds up a smaller version.] the neck protector junior, and now, for a limited time, [He holds up a version with a flower on it.] the lady neck protector!
	Hermes	I'll take two. My neck is huge.
	Professor Farnsworth	We're perfectly safe now. Time to stop living like a bunch of nervous nellies. [A diagrams on the screen shows a dotted line disappearing from around the building. "SECURITY SYSTEM OFFLINE" flashes on the screen.]
	Leela	[She examines the invention.] Professor, these look like you cut them from cardboard toilet paper tubes.
	Professor Farnsworth	So? [The hangar doors retract open.] Lots of important inventions are made from toilet paper tubes. [Farnsworth looks back to the keyboard and screen and Leela spots a tentacle in Farnsworth's neck.] Microscopes, the internet, tentacle polish...
	Leela	It got the professor!
	Hermes	Wait, why am I screaming? It got me, too! [He floats up to Farnsworth.]
	Wernstrom	Stop, in the name of love!
	Leela	Crud. We may be the last two normal people on Earth. At least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore.
	Amy	I'm scared! And I miss Kif!
	Leela	It's okay to cry, Amy. Come here, I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps. [They hug.]
	Zapp	[He pops the top of his head out of a dumpster.] Mmm. What an erotic display of girl-on-girl consolation.
	Leela	Zapp?
	Zapp	Hurry, Leela, we don't have much time to begin repopulating Earth. Go brush your teeth. I'll be waiting for you naked under this keh-suh-dilluh. [He places the Mexican treat on his head and saunters back down into the dumpster. Hermes floats into the alley with a gang of tentacles around him. Amy, Leela and Zapp gasp.]
	Hermes	Stop resisting, my brethren! Don't you want to be part of something bigger than yourselves? Like a big crazy monster? [Zapp whimpers.]
	Fry	So we got her, huh? Bring her in!
	Zoidberg	Do it already! [He motions at someone.]
	Fry	Hello, Colleen.
	Colleen	Fry, please!
	Colleen	If this is about your futon, I sold it to pay the phone bill that you skipped out on!
	Fry	Colleen wasn't satisfied with me. Were you, Colleen?
	Colleen	Come on, Fry, this isn't cool!
	Fry	She had to have four other boyfriends! I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world!
	Colleen	You know what? It's true! You weren't enough for me! No one man is! You were great, but you weren't Chinese, you weren't Cameroonian, and you certainly were not the "king of karaoke," as you so often claimed. [Fry is aghast.] And if your ego can't take that, then you don't deserve to be tentacle pope of anything!
	Fry	Oh, yeah, Colleen? Well, I've got one thing to say to you. [He lowers down to her.] (Calm) I completely agree!
	Colleen	You, you... What?
	Fry	Why should you be satisfied with one man when love needs to share itself with the whole universe?
	Colleen	Wow, Fry. You know, that's really... [Fry moves a tentacle in front of her face and she shrieks as it grabs onto her neck.]
	Fry	Love the tentacle, honey.
	Colleen	I do love the tentacle.
	Fry	Come on out, guys! [Chu, Schlomo, Ndulu and Bolt come out of hiding.] There's enough love for everybody! [They all hug and raise into the air higher.]
	Zoidberg	Aw. [He throws up salt water fish and a duck with water into two buckets. The duck flaps it feathers and quacks.]
	Amy	We're trapped!
	Leela	Help, help! Is anyone out there?
	Bender	Bender to Leela. I read you. [Pull out, Bender is leaning against the wall a couple of feet away from them.] (Direct) 'Sup, bigboots?
	Leela	Bender, we need a place to hide!
	Amy	Please!
	Zapp	Pretty please!
	Bender	You humans are so cute when you're scared. In here.
	Destructor	My leg feels funny!
	Bender	Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once. I almost barfed.
	Destructor	Did you know their hair just keeps growing and growing? My leg feels funny!
	Amy	Leela, you're crushing me with your rock-hard butt.
	Leela	Sorry.
	Zapp	[A close view of his face. It is moving back and forth.] Mmm. I can only imagine what rock-hard part of Leela is crushing me. [Pull back to reveal it is a actuator ramming into the back of his head.]
	Calculon	Anyone mind if I turn up the heat a tad?
	Zapp	I can't take it! I'm being steamed in my own velour!
	Bender	Death to humans!
	Destructor	My leg feels better!
	Amy	Hi, Bender.
	Calculon	Bender, you know these humans?
	Bender	Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit? [He rushes them towards a hallway.] Go, go, go!
	Leela	Thanks for everything, Bender! [A bookshelf slides in front of the path they escaped from.]
	Bender	Death to all of you!
	Calculon	Bender, methinks thou doth protest too much.
	Hedonism Bot	It seems Bender hates humans the way I hate having my nipples polished with industrial sandpaper.
	British Robot	Quite right.
	Calculon	It's okay, Bender, to heir is human.
	Bender	Sir, you forget yourself!
	Bender	I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor.
	Hedonism Bot	Oh, my... [He puts his hand on his forehead and faints, falling onto Boxy and crushing him. Boxy frantically beeps, but they slow in speed and pitch and eventually stop.]
	Zapp	Leela, it's getting dark. We may have to make a tent out of Amy's skin.
	Amy	Look, there's an abandoned cabin!
	Zapp	Even so.
	Leela	We're in luck. This must have been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition.
	Zapp	[He drinks a ladle-full of soup.] Oh, yeah. Bathtub minestrone.
	Zapp	Ditto on the grief there, Amy.
	Amy	You miss him, too?
	Zapp	[He sits next to her.] More than you, as his mere wife, could ever understand. He was my fourth lieutenant, for God's sake, and bore the peppermill at the captain's table.
	Amy	Really?
	Zapp	Oh, Amy, I miss him so! Hardly a month goes by that I don't think of him. But you know, in a way, he's still with us. [Amy looks around.] Do you feel his presence?
	Amy	I'm not sure.
	Zapp	It's over here. [Amy moves closer to Zapp and looks around more.] Closer.
	Leela	Amy! Zapp! I fetched up some fresh soup!
	Zapp	Sorry you had to find out like this, Leela. I was hoping you'd see it on YouTube first. [Two tentacles sneak up behind the two of them and Leela points at them. She is too scared to speak.] As my ex-lover, you're naturally shocked and jealous, but you may well get your chance again someday. How about today at 4:00?
	Amy	Hey, this isn't so bad.
	Zapp	She's right. Leela, you must try the tentacle. It's like my soul is wearing a velour body glove.
	Leela	Get off me! I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula.
	Professor Farnsworth	What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston.
	Leela	No, it can't be. [The lights flick on.]
	Professor Farnsworth	Leela, what's your favourite thing about the tentacle? [He gasps and the tentacles react to it.] You don't have a tentacle! Get her! Get her some love!
	Zoidberg	You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff? [The staff moves up and down and a slide whistle is heard.]
	Fry	The tentacle monster is about to address the world. It's too serious.
	Zoidberg	Oh. [The staff moves down and a slide whistle is heard again.]
	Leela	Hello, Fry.
	Fry	Leela? How did you get past my sumo ninjas?
	Leela	I told them something so shocking that they let me by.
	Fry	What's that?
	Leela	I love the tentacle. [She turns a little to reveal a tentacles is in her neck.]
	Zoidberg	We're rolling in three, two... What? We're already rolling?
	Fry	Love the tentacle!
	ALL	Love the tentacle!
	Fry	Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name.
	Morbo	What is our love's name?
	Fry	Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of "he" or "she," we are to use the word "shklee." And instead of "him" or "her," we are to use the word "shklim," or "shkler."
	Hermes	Phew! I've been sweating the nomenclature all week.
	Fry	So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo!
	Colleen	Yay, Yivo!
	Yivo	Attention, beings of Universe Gamma.
	Zoidberg	Where?
	Yivo	Here.
	Zoidberg	I had a hunch.
	Yivo	I am Yivo. In your universe, you are many, but in my universe, I am one. [On the Jumbotron, people are watching him.] For a trillion years I dwelt in solitude, content with my job and my stamp collecting, [On a TV on the Nude Beach Planet Bar.] but then I looked across immensity [On a TV in Lrrr's house.] and saw the big bang, and I was, like, [Back at the church.] "Whoa, who's that?" And I knew then that I was lonely.
	Morbo	You poor monster!
	Yivo	Then your emissary Fry came unto me, and he, too, was lonely. So I reached into your universe that we might feel each other's touch.
	Leela	[She stands up.] Hey, Yivo, feel this.
	Yivo	Ow!
	Leela	People of everywhere, I have shocking news.
	Yivo	Hey, butt out! This is between me and everyone else in existence.
	Leela	Yivo talks a lot about love, but what he's actually doing...
	Hermes	What shklee's actually doing.
	Leela	...is mating with you! [The congregation murmurs to each other. She pulls out and holds up the sample she used.] These aren't tentacles. They're genticles.
	Fry	Ew!
