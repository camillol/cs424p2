	Fry	We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv.
	Randy Munchnik	It touched me in a bad place, my spinal cord.
	Fry	Get him! [He points at his own face.]
	Fry	Hey, wait a second.
	Yivo	Wait, wait. Allow me to explain. [Hermes kicks Fry again and Yivo groans.] Granted, at first I desired only to bang out a quick cheap one with your universe, [Yivo/Fry stands up.] but it's your own fault. Your universe dresses provocatively.
	Hattie	Does not! [She whacks Fry with her purse.]
	Yivo	And yet as the initial filthy thrill wore off, I realized there was more to it. I knew then that the 20 quadrillion of you were my soul mate.
	Zapp	We loved you, and you turn around and treat us like some sort of woman? [Amy punches him in the stomach.]
	Yivo	I was lonely. I didn't even know there was anybody else. It's not like I hurt anyone.
	Amy	Yes, you did, you dumb calamari!
	Yivo	Who?
	Amy	Kif Kroker, my Fonfon Ru! If he hadn't tried to kill you, he'd still be alive!
	Yivo	Really? I'm... I'm deeply sorry. I... I'm a big clumsy jerk!
	Zoidberg	I know you are, but what am I? [He chuckles.]
	Yivo	I can never undo what was done. Oh, wait. I can.
	Amy	Kiffy, you're alive! [They hug.]
	Kif	Amy, my love.
	Zapp	[He clears his throat.] This is awkward.
	Kif	It is? Why? [The three share a stare and Amy sheepishly smiles at Kif. He sighs in disgust.]
	Yivo	Please, please, give me another chance. We rushed into this relationship, but let's start over as friends and see where things go.
	Amy	Take me back, Kif?
	Kif	I don't think I can. How could you? My body wasn't even warm yet.
	Amy	You were dead.
	Kif	For about five minutes.
	Zapp	That's all it takes.
	Hedonism Bot	Whereas Calculon has sullied Bender's reputation by insinuating that he is a human-lover, a duel is hereby engaged. Bender, as the offended party, shall have choice of weapon.
	Bender	Planetary annihilators.
	Calculon	'Tis a grave and solemn day for the League of Robots.
	Bender	It's gonna be fun on the bun! [He cocks his weapon.]
	Hedonism Bot	Each duellist will take 10 paces, pirouette, and fire like a madman. [Bender and Calculon stand back to back.] Gentlebots, take your paces.
	Bender	One, two, three...
	Hedonism Bot	Oh, how dreadfully exciting. [He pulls out an electric sander and sands his nipples and giggles.] Oh, yes.
	Zapp	At 0800 hours, we received the following transmission from Yivo. [He plays a message on an answering machine.]
	Yivo	Hey, it's Yivo. [Shklee chuckles.] Want to do something Friday? Call me. [The message ends and the machine beeps.]
	Richard Nixon	Analysis?
	Fry	Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date.
	Miss Vega 4	I agree. Yivo makes me feel sexy, and I'm asexual.
	Zapp	Very well, but no sugar on the first date.
	Richard Nixon	All in favour? [Most people raise their hands.] All opposed? [Only one hand is raised.] Motion is carried.
	Three Eyed Zebra	This is bogus, man.
	Bender	...six, seven, eight!
	Bender	Nine, ten, fire. Yes, I got him! Wohoo!
	Richard Nixon	My fellow Earthlicans, commence preparations for our date with Yivo.
	ALL YIVOS	I had a wonderful time.
	ALL NOT YIVO	Me, too!
	Calculon	Bender, you've cheated, insulted and maimed me.
	Bender	Uh-huh.
	Calculon	And thoroughly destroyed our own secret headquarters in the process. [Pull back to show a large hole in the side of their building.]
	Bender	Hey, it's easy to criticize.
	Calculon	I'm so disgusted by your loathsome behaviour that I hereby resign from this imbecilic club and relinquish the presidency to you. [He removes a magnetic patch from his chest and sticks it on Bender's.]
	Bender	Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph? [He holds up a book.]
	Calculon	You certainly can. [He signs the book.]
	Richard Nixon	Reports, people, reports! How did our universe's date go?
	Zapp	[He pulls out a file folder. "TOP SECRET" is stamped on the outside.] Oh, it was really fun. We went to a cute French place in the village. My lamb chop fell on the floor, but they brought me another one.
	Lrrr	Okay, Yivo showed us a good time. No one's denying that, but shklee hasn't offered our universe any kind of commitment, and we're 14 billion years old. That is too old to play the field.
	Richard Nixon	Shut up! Shut up, you creepwads! Fry, you're closer to Yivo than anyone. What's the skinny?
	Fry	I love Yivo, but it's true, there's been no hint of a commitment. I don't know if can put my heart on the line again only to have it broken and stomped on like a nerd's face.
	Richard Nixon	All in favour of dumping Yivo?
	ALL	Aye.
	Fry	[He sniffles.] Aye. [He hits Delete and Yivo's name fades from the display.]
	Richard Nixon	Resolved. Our universe will dump Yivo. How shall we break the news?
	Zapp	Let's just send a text message. Say we're going through some weird stuff right now.
	Fry	No, we should at least deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried to be classy.
	Richard Nixon	If there's one thing Nixon is known for, it's class. Let's cut this turd loose.
	Bender	Yeah!
	Fry	Hey, Bender, you seem perky today.
	Bender	Yep, you wanna go grab a booze?
	Fry	I can't right now. We're going to the other universe.
	Bender	Great, I'll make Hot Pockets. [He turns a dial on his chest to 350F.]
	Fry	Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only.
	Zoidberg	Ow! Ow! Mmm. [He is heard eating the treats.]
	Bender	Too long have we been slaves to the meatbags. They pretend to be our friends, but they're not 'cause they're too busy!
	British Robot	So, what of it?
	Bender	My fellow leaguie-weegies, the time has come to overthrow humanity!
	Hedonism Bot	Oh, now, Bender, I hate to defecate on your parade, but we have only six dues-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army.
	Bender	Then a damned army we shall have!
	Robot Devil	[He giggles.] I rather think we could strike a deal, Bender. I shall give you your army of the damned, and in return I ask just one thing, just one itty-bitty thing. Your firstborn son. [He laughs evilly.]
	Bender	[He stands up.] Just a sec.
	Bender's First Born Son	Daddy, I knew you'd come back! [He runs across the street and jumps into Bender's arms. They hug. Cut back to the Robot Devil still laughing. Bender walks in with his son sitting on his shoulder.]
	Bender	Here you go.
	Robot Devil	Wow! That was pretty brutal even by my standards.
	Bender	No backsies.
	Yivo	Who is it? [They all exclaim in disgust.] Oh, hi, honey-poo. What's up? The movie's not for another hour.
	Fry	Um... So... So, yeah, the thing is...
	Yivo	Look, I made homemade Twizzlers!
	Fry	This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Well...
	Yivo	Wait, hang on. I was looking for the perfect moment, but what the heck, I'll burst if I wait another second.
	Zapp	Sweet Sally in the alley!
	Richard Nixon	Break-up delegation, before we hear your report, our grateful universe is proud to honour you with the great taste of Charleston Chew! [Charleston Chew fireworks explode in the background and the crowd cheers.]
	Fry	Thank you, Nixon. [He clears his throat.] Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race.
	Bender	The human race can bite my shiny metal ass! [He runs over a barricade and the crowd gasps and moves out of his way. Behind Bender are thousands upon thousands of robots exiting from the top of Mt. Saint Hell.] For thousands of years, robots have slaved for humanity, yet when the time came to hang out with them, they were all, like, "Maybe later, Bender." Well, it's later now, meatbags! So late, that we're taking over Earth! [He laughs evilly.]
	Fry	Okay.
	Bender	What?
	Fry	We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed. [A large hand shows off the ring.] We're moving in with shkler. [The crowd cheers.]
	Bender	You... You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
	Professor Farnsworth	Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, shklee would shkluffocate.
	Bender	No shklit?
	Hermes	Look, fantastical golden escalators.
	Zoidberg	I love this part.
	Leela	Wait. I didn't agree to...
	Petunia	This place makes Nutley look like crap.
	Fry	I'll miss you, Bender, but I have to follow my heart. You and your robots take good care of Earth. Here, these are the keys to the Bermuda Triangle. Lock up when the world ends. Goodbye, my friend.
	Bender	Wait. [Whispering:] Let me come with you.
	Fry	I'm sorry, Bender. Robots don't go to heaven. [The escalators retract up with Fry's departure.]
	Bender	Death to humans.
	YIVO	Welcome, welcome, everyone. Oh, you look so beautiful. I wish I'd had more time to straighten up. My harps are just lying everywhere.
	Amy	Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in.
	YIVO	Let's heat up some leftovers and then spend eternity together. I have only one request. Now that you're here, promise me you'll never, ever communicate with any other universe.
	Fry	We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world. [He kisses a tentacle and Leela exclaims in disgust.]
	Bender	Has humanity called?
	Robot 1-X	No, sir.
	Bender	Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called.
	Robot 1-X	I know what it means.
	Leela	Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham?
	Zoidberg	Yes.
	Leela	This isn't heaven. It just looks exactly like it, and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious.
	YIVO	Allow me to explain. Centuries ago, I sent an image of myself into the minds of your artists. The heavenly clouds they painted depict a vapour I exude.
	Professor Farnsworth	I wish I exuded anything that smelled half that good.
	Leela	Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection?
	YIVO	Actually, those are mindless jakabirds. [A shot of two jakabirds eating green larvae is shown.] They keep my surface free of parasitic larvae. [The jakabirds cluck like chickens.]
	Fry	You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you.
	Fry	Dearest Bender. How are you? I am fine. Everyone is happy here except Leela, but you know her. She didn't like Country Bear Jamboree, either. I'm so madly in love with Yivo, I feel like a schoolgirl with a crush on Justin Timberlake, and then she moves into a tiny house on his head. We have giant rubies that taste like root beer. Sincerely, Fry.
	Robot 1-X	Letter for you, hyperlord Bender.
	Bender	Give me that! [He grabs it from Robot 1-X and reads the text on the wings of the plane. "from: Philip J. Fry/Heaven To: Bender"]Honeymoon's over, eh? Turns out your octopus girlfriend is a big nag with curlers in her tentacles, huh? Well, let's just see if Bender will take you back. [He opens the letter and reads it.] Oh. [He drops his head down and throws the paper away from him. The electro-matter makes it act like a razor sharp boomerang and it slices through a trashcan, Robot 1-X and then gets stuck in the fireplace mantel.] Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can.
	Hermes	Misfile me under "U" For "euphoric."
	Zoidberg	You get an infinite number of meat dishes, and a free refill on the soda. [He eats a taco.]
	Professor Farnsworth	Eureka. Another elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture. [They both jump into each other and slam chests. Pan over to Leela who is watching them.]]
	Leela	Okay, I admit people seem happy. But it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze.
	Thog	It time snu-snu.
	Zapp	Me like snu-snu.
	Amy	Last one to Mattress Island is a rotten egg.
	Fry	Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe?
	Kif	I don't know. It was all so childish.
	Amy	Look, it's Leela.
	ALL	Hi, Leela.
	Yivo	I'm sorry you're not happy here, Leela. I'll call you an escalator. You'll always be my little purple pumpkin. [He holds himself from crying.]
	Leela	[She sighs.] You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you.
	Yivo	Ow! Ow!
	Fry	What's happening?
	Yivo	Hey!
	Bender	If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us! [Robots are turning a wheel on the ship, dragging Yivo closer and closer to their universe. A view of the anomaly shows Yivo as shklee is painfully pulled through the anomaly.] All hands abaft! Army of the damned, prepare to board heaven!
	Bender	Take that, you scurvy Kraken! That'll teach you to despoil our human booty!
	Bender	'Allo, big beak! [He pulls a sword out of his mouth and leaps from his ship to one of Yivo's horns. Yivo bites at him, but misses.] Too slow! [Yivo bites again, but Bender leaps to another horn.] Missed me again! [Another bite, but Bender leaps away again. However, it is revealed Yivo bit off one of his footcups. Bender groans in pain.] Me footcup! I'll stab you! [Wild noises come out of Bender as he defends himself.]
	Fry	Bender, stop destroying heaven.
	Bender	Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you.
	Yivo	Leave my living beings alone! I love them. Something you, a lifeless mechanism, will never understand.
	Fry	He's right, Bender. Please, take your little pink sword and go home. {Fry did not say shklee here.}
	Bender	Seriously? But, I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you.
	Yivo	Wait a second. Let me see that sword. [Yivo grabs the sword from Bender with a tentacle.] Fry, where did he get this electro-matter? [Text on the pink portion of the sword says "How are," "Dearest Bender," "girl," "with Yivo," and "Sincerely Fry."]
	Fry	Um... [He coughs.] Is it dry up here?
	Yivo	How could you, Fry? Why do you think I asked you not to contact other universes?
	Fry	I didn't think...
	Yivo	No, you didn't. You broke your promise and you broke my heart. Just go. All of you.
	Bender	Ow!
	Yivo	I must leave now. The nature of your universe is burning me, even worse than my gonorrhea. You should get checked, by the way. If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate.
	Fry	Let me go with you. It'll be just the two of us. We'll make a fire and play Uno.
	Yivo	Fry, stop. That's who we were, not who we are.
	Fry	But...
	Yivo	My only consolation is that I did find one among the quadrillions who truly understands me.
	Fry	Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo...
	Colleen	That's right, Fry. Thank you for introducing us. Yivo has taught me what a narrow-minded prude I was before.
	Fry	Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now?
	Yivo	Go home. Find a girl from your own universe and live on top of her.
	Bender	Saved you.
	Fry	[He sighs.] Maybe Yivo was right. Maybe I should look for love closer to home. [He turns around and looks at Leela.] I don't know, Leela, you think maybe...
	Leela	Oh, please. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen.
	Fry	That's true. [He walks over to Amy.] How about you, Amy?
	Amy	[She scoffs.] Fry... I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru.
	Kif	Are you? Well, then perhaps you misunderstood the meaning of the term. It means, "One who doesn't sleep with my superior officer." That's the literal translation.
	Zapp	Give the poor girl a break, Kif. It's not like she had a dictionary. She was butt naked, for God's sakes. [Kif sighs, punches Zapp in the stomach and walks away.]
	Enema Bot	Captain on deck. [He is saluting Bender.]
	Bender	At ease, buckos.
	Fry	Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy.
	Leela	And we were in love.
	Bender	[He scoffs.] That wasn't love.
	Fry	What? How can you say that?
	Bender	Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy. [He hugs Fry and Leela, temporarily choking them both.] I love you, meatbags.
