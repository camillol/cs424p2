00:16	Bender	[singing] Going through the 'bot wash!
00:20	Bender	[singing] Goin' through the robot wash!C'mon, y'all and sing it with me,'Bot wash! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,'Bot wash, yeah!
00:45	Bender	Ah!
01:24	Elzar	[on TV] Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive all the way to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug. [He hoots and turns on the oven.] Now, while you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees, you're gonna separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the whole thing a good blast from your spice weasel. Bam!
01:51	Fry	Hey, what you watching?
01:52	Bender	Uh, nothing!
01:53	Leela	Is that a cooking show?
01:54	Bender	No, of course not! It was ... uh ... porno! Yeah, that's it!
02:01	Leela	Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
02:04	Bender	[ashamed] Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.
02:08	Fry	It's OK, Bender. I like cooking too.
02:11	Bender	[whispering] Pansy!
02:12	Elzar	[on TV] Of course, your most important ingredient is this baby right here: The Neptunian slug. You can get it in a can but to really do things right you gotta strangle yourself a fresh one. [He pulls the slug out of it's box and it grows rapidly.] Now this is why you gotta use cast-iron cookware.
02:37	Hermes	Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch.
02:43	Bender	You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
02:46	Hermes	I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
02:51	Bender	Hmm.
02:53	Fry	You're gonna be the ships cook?
02:55	Bender	Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
02:57	Leela	I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste.
03:02	Bender	Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.
03:06	Fry	Bam!
03:11	Fry	So this is Little Neptune?
03:13	Bender	Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
03:18	Leela	Among other things.
03:26	Crack Addict	Come on, man! Don't hold out on me like this!
03:31	Organ Dealer	Psst! You want to buy organ? [He opens his coat to reveal human organs pinned to the inside like knock-off watches.] Fresh and cheap. Ready for transplant!
03:35	Fry	[pointing] Ooh! What's this?
03:36	Organ Dealer	Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!
03:40	Fry	Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
03:42	Organ Dealer	Z is just as good. In fact, is better. Is two more than X.
03:46	Fry	Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?
03:50	Leela	Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here.
03:56	Fry	I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. [He waves to an alien.] What up?
04:01	Alien	Word!
04:02	Fry	See?
04:04	Fry	Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
04:07	Neptunian Salesman #1	What? You want human?
04:09	Leela	What's this spice for?
04:11	Neptunian Salesman #2	That's powdered swamp root. Makes you irresistible to the opposite sex.
04:14	Leela	Oh, that's ridiculous! (whispering) I'll take two pounds!
04:22	Bender	Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.
04:25	Neptunian Salesman #1	Yellow or purple?
04:26	Bender	Whatever.
04:27	Neptunian Salesman #1	The purple one causes terrible nightmare-ish diarrhoea.
04:29	Bender	Yeah, yeah. Either one's fine.
04:32	Leela	Hey, have you seen Fry?
04:34	Fry	Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.
04:39	Organ Dealer	Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?
04:43	Fry	Can't imagine why I would.
04:45	Organ Dealer	Lie down on table. I take lungs now, gills come next week. [Fry lies on the table.] (shouting) Nurse!
04:54	Nurse	Let's do it.
04:56	Organ Dealer	You may feel small pain--
05:04	Bender	[shouting] Thank you!
05:07	Leela	What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
05:10	Fry	I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?
05:16	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, everyone--
05:17	Bender	Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
05:19	Professor Farnsworth	You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
05:22	Bender	Here it comes.
05:23	Professor Farnsworth	A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
05:28	Bender	Thank you, and goodnight.
05:29	Leela	Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
05:33	Professor Farnsworth	Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror!
05:42	Leela	Uh, Professor--
05:43	Professor Farnsworth	Off you go. Pleasant trip!
05:50	Fry	[shouting] Hey, Bender, how's dinner coming?
05:52	Bender	[shouting; from galley] Almost ready!
06:00	Bender	Now for a dash of salt! [He coats the slug in salt and it starts to shrivel up.] Uh-oh!
06:12	Leela	[whispering] Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?
06:17	Fry	Yeah, OK.
06:18	Zoidberg	Alright.
06:20	Leela	[shouting] Oh, dear God!
06:23	Fry	That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I've once ate a big, heaping bowl of salt!
06:30	Amy	Bender, is this salt water?
06:31	Bender	It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
06:35	Fry	My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
06:37	Bender	There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
06:44	Zoidberg	Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
06:53	Leela	OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver. And for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.
07:02	Fry	Ow!
07:03	Leela	Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back.
07:09	Fry	Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.
07:25	Fry	Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. [He looks across at the setting sun.] Oh, come on! Go down already! [The sun finally sets.] Ah!
07:53	Fry	Hello? Anybody home?
08:14	Guard #1	The royal bottle is empty!
08:16	Guard #2	You drank our Emperor!
08:18	Fry	No! It wasn't me!
08:25	Guard #1	[shouting] You drank our Emperor! You assassinated him!
08:28	Fry	I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
08:31	Guard #3	I'm sure he was.
08:33	Guard #1	But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. All hail the new Emperor.
08:41	Guards	[chanting] Hail! Hail! Hail!
08:46	Leela	So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!
08:53	Fry	It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
08:57	Merg	Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?
09:01	Fry	You might.
09:02	Merg	I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.
09:09	Gorgak	I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
09:12	Bender	You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.
09:16	Fry	I gotta go with Bender.
09:17	Bender	Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
09:19	Leela	That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head.
09:24	Fry	Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.
09:28	Bender	Stay the course, pal!
09:30	Gorgak	Your Highness, a package came for you.
09:34	Fry	Hey, thanks! [He takes the package and opens it. It is a sign saying "Please Don't Drink The Emperor!"] Wow! This got here just in time.
09:43	Merg	This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
09:48	Fry	Um, how about that one?
09:51	Merg	Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
09:55	Fry	On second thought, I'll take that one.
09:58	Merg	Hey, whatever you say. I'm not here to pass judgement.
10:01	Leela	Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?
10:08	Fry	You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela. We all know who you're talking about ... uh, me, right?
10:14	Amy	I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
10:18	Zoidberg	They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now.
10:23	Gorgak	You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
10:28	Merg	Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's coronation ceremony.
10:33	Zoidberg	A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
10:37	Merg	Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.
10:43	Fry	There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?
10:45	Merg	Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.
10:53	Fry	Will there be cake?
10:57	Zoidberg	Yeah, I know.
10:58	Amy	[to Gorgak] Hi!
11:01	Fry	There you go.
11:09	Gorgak	And now, get ready to laugh till your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!
11:20	Florp	So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all... [He does a funny walk. Fry laughs.] But us guys from under the red sun, we're like... [He imitates does another funny walk.] Right? Am I right?
11:38	Fry	Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!
11:41	Leela	[whispering] Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.
11:46	Leela	You see Emperor Plon here? [She points at a painting.] He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.
11:53	Fry	So?
11:54	Leela	Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
11:59	Fry	80,000 years?
12:00	Leela	No. One week.
12:02	Fry	Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
12:06	Leela	Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
12:15	Fry	Well, at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
12:17	Leela	You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation.
12:22	Fry	Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.
12:25	Leela	No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.
12:33	Fry	Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.
12:35	Leela	That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
12:38	Fry	Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?
13:04	Leela	I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
13:08	Fry	Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts, you nagging grasshopper.
13:16	Leela	That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.
13:22	Fry	I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me. [A panel slides across on a portrait and a Trisolian tries to drink Fry with a straw.] Quit it!
13:34	Merg	People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor.
13:45	Fry	What up?
13:48	Merg	Stick to the oath.
13:49	Fry	Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...
14:00	Fry	(reading) Who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity-- Uh, integrity!
14:12	Merg	Congratulations, Your Highness. [He takes Fry's shirt off him.] I now present you with your royal unisex robe. Long live Fry the Solid!
14:26	Bender	Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!
14:43	Bender	Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?
14:52	Merg	The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
14:55	Bont	Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
15:01	Fry	My tummy hurts!
15:08	Bont	They're over here, they're running up the stairs.
15:10	Bender	Shut up, you!
15:12	Fry	Ow!
15:18	Merg	Let us in!
15:19	Merg	[from outside] Fry must die so that Bont may live.
15:22	Fry	What am I gonna do?
15:23	Amy	We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
15:26	Zoidberg	Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.
15:33	Fry	But won't that crush my bones?
15:35	Zoidberg	Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
15:39	Bender	Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
15:41	Bont	Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.
15:45	Fry	I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
15:48	Bont	Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
15:51	Amy	What about crying?
15:52	Fry	That's a great idea! Crying.
15:55	Bont	Fine. That or the bone one.
16:00	Merg	Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel.
16:03	Gorgak	Oh, dear!
16:07	Fry	It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
16:10	Bender	I'll make you cry, buddy! [He clears his throat.] You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.
16:17	Fry	What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
16:20	Bender	Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
16:28	Fry	These things happen.
16:31	Bender	OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!
16:40	Fry	Phew! That's a load off my mind.
16:43	Bender	Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
16:46	Amy	You did your best, Bender.
16:47	Bender	Up yours, bimbo!
16:51	Zoidberg	Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
16:55	Bender	Cram it, lobster! [Zoidberg bursts into tears.] That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
17:00	Fry	She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
17:04	Amy	C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
17:13	Operator	[on phone] Collect call from...
17:14	Bender	[on phone] I'm not giving my name to a machine.
17:16	Leela	I'll accept.
17:18	Bender	[on screen] Fry's in trouble...
17:20	Bender	And he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me.
17:23	Leela	[on screen] I like you.
17:24	Bender	You do? Look, are you going to help or not?
17:28	Leela	[on screen] I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--
17:30	Bender	Wait, wait, wait, wait. [He crosses his legs and taps his chin.] What is it you like best about me?
17:33	Amy	Is she coming?
17:34	Bender	I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
17:48	Fry	What the hell is that?
17:49	Bont	Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains.
17:56	Zoidberg	Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
17:59	Fry	This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
18:06	Bender	Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
18:17	Amy	Oh, no! They have her totally outnumbered.
18:20	Fry	I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
18:27	Bender	You do? Hmm.
18:30	Fry	Is she alright?
18:31	Bender	I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.
18:40	Fry	No. No!
18:41	Amy	What are you talking about, Bender? She's al-- [Bender puts his hand over Amy's mouth and she eventually catches on.] (muffled) Oh!
18:44	Bender	They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.
18:52	Fry	This can't be happening.
18:53	Bender	It can and, for all you know, it is. [He puts his hand on Fry's shoulder.] I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
19:09	Fry	All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it. [He throws his crown across the room.] I wish I had died instead of her.
19:18	Leela	What are you talking about?
19:21	Fry	Leela! You're alive!
19:22	Leela	Of course I'm alive.
19:24	Bender	I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
19:30	Amy	We only got two drops.
19:37	Bont	It's only a matter of time now.
19:39	Zoidberg	I'll handle this!
19:45	Leela	Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.
19:48	Fry	Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me. [Leela smiles then stamps on his foot.] Ow! What was that for? [She slaps him.] Hey, come on! [He bursts into tears.] That hurt!
20:03	Leela	I know. Amy, get the bottle.
20:09	Fry	[crying] Oh, now I understand.
20:10	Leela	Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
20:17	Fry	[crying] Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true-- Ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!
20:26	Leela	How we doing, Amy?
20:27	Amy	Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
20:37	Amy	OK, it's your turn.
20:40	Fry	Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?
20:43	Bont	I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
20:47	Fry	Oh, you're welcome.
20:55	Bender	[from inside] Hey! Save some for me!
