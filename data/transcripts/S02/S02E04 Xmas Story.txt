	Announcer	Ladies and gentlemen, Conan O'Brien's head.
	O'Brien	Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. Max, play me over. [Max Weinberg's head is just a skull in a jar. O'Brien gasps.] Looks like someone forgot to feed Max. [Bender spits his drink out and laughs.] So, people are getting pretty worried about this Y2K problem, huh?
	Bender	No, they fixed that 900 years ago.
	O'Brien	Just bear with me, sir. Anyway, I'm walking to work this morning--
	Bender	I doubt it!
	O'Brien	Listen, pal, I may have lost my freakishly long legs in the war of 2012 but I've still got something you'll never have: A soul!
	Bender	Eh.
	O'Brien	And freckles! [Bender cries.] Well, I'm out of material. You can catch me next week at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut. Enjoy your breakfast.
	Bender	Ah, lets face it: Comedy's a dead art form. Now, tragedy... [He laughs.] That's funny!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien.
	Amy	Yeah!
	Leela	Great idea!
	Zoidberg	We can only hope!
	Fry	This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
	Leela	Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
	Fry	Hi!
	Bender	Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.
	Hermes	Jah damnit! We're stuck.
	Zoidberg	[shivering] At least you're not cold-blooded!
	Hermes	Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.
	Fry	Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
	Leela	Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down.
	Trees	[mechanical voice] Trees down.
	Fry	Cool. Hey, what do you do if you want the trees up?
	Trees	[mechanical voice] Trees up.
	Fry	[hoarse] Trees down!
	Trees	[mechanical voice] Trees down.
	Bender	Lookin' good, meatball!
	Man #1	Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail.
	Bender	Lick my frozen, metal ass. [He laughs.] Uh-oh!
	Child	[shouting] Mommy!
	Zoidberg	You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!
	Hermes	Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsledders.
	Fry	Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages.
	Hermes	A true inspiration for the children. [A buzzer goes off and the gates open. The bobsled doesn't move forward and it tips over.] Um, a little help please? [Zoidberg pushes the bobsled and it slides down the track upside-down.] [screaming] Nooo!
	Fry	Oh, what the hell! [He takes a run up and slides after Hermes and Zoidberg. He hits something at the bottom.] Ow!
	Amy	You poor man. What happened to you?
	Man #2	Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--
	Amy	Oh, excuse me. [She runs over to a man in a whole body cast.] Hello, there!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wha?
	Bender	Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
	Fry	Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.
	Prof. Farnsworth	What-mas?
	Fry	Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
	Leela	Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say "ask" instead of "aks".
	Fry	Xmas, huh? [He sighs.] Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home.
	Leela	Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?
	Fry	Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
	Fry	Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Eh, wha?
	Fry	They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. [He takes his coat off, exposing his naked body to all.] Ah! Brisk!
	Fry	This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
	Prof. Farnsworth	There, there.
	Fry	Everything's changed.
	Leela	That's not true.
	Bender	[singing]Â : Xmas tree, oh, Xmas tree! Bah-boo-bee-boo-bah-bee-boh.
	Amy	Ow!
	Fry	Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. [Amy flies around the room and crashes.] This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
	Hermes	Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas! [The staff gather around.] Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender.
	Bender	Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
	Hermes	And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office: Me. Hermes Conrad.
	Bender	Hmm. [He opens the card. The message reads "Merry Xmas Son #1729". With it is a photo of a robotic arm.] Ah, a picture of my mommy.
	Zoidberg	Huh? What's this? [His card it shaped like a lobster.] A card from my cousin Zoidfarb. [The message reads "Santa "Claws" Cousin Zoidfarb". Zoidberg chuckles.] Instead of "Claus" he writes "Claws"! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card.
	Fry	What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth. [Enter Leela, drying her tears.] Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh? [She runs out crying more.] Yoiks! What was that about?
	Amy	Fluh! She's an orphan.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life.
	Fry	My God! Poor Leela.
	Bender	[upbeat] Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well, old Bender'll make you laugh. [He dances around.] Look at me, look! [He scats and Fry bursts into tears.] Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!
	Fry	I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
	Amy	I'll do it for you.
	Fry	Ow! Thanks.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops.
	Hermes	Fry's over there, man.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh?
	Bender	Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
	Linda	[on TV] The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.
	Morbo	[on TV] Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.
	Linda	[on TV] Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots. [The TV picture cuts to a robot shelter.] Homeless robots, too poor to afford even the basic alcohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them.
	Amy	Where are you going, Bender?
	Bender	To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
	Hermes	Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable.
	Bender	I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
	Fry	Whose blood?
	Bender	Some guy's.
	Fry	I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
	Zoidberg	So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
	Fry	So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again.
	Hermes	Just be back by sundown, mon.
	Fry	We'll see. I like to haggle.
	Amy	You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
	Fry	Say what?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
	Fry	I know about Santa Claus.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong.
	Fry	Wow! 2801! Anyway...
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty.
	Amy	If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Nice meeting you.
	Preacherbot	Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you.
	Bender	Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze. [The Preacherbot points.] Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
	Fry	There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
	Salesman #1	Yeah, there's a suicide booth in the food court. Though there's a line this time of year.
	Fry	No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.
	Salesman #1	Well, you can't go wrong with something traditional. [He picks something up.] A Surface-to-Santa rocket launcher. It comes with three jolly-seeking missiles.
	Fry	That's funny!
	Salesman #1	Careful, sir!
	Bender	Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live. [He turns to another robot.] Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap.
	Tinny Tim	Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?
	Preacherbot	I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight.
	Tinny Tim	I understand.
	Bender	My God! That poor kid!
	Fry	You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela. [He looks at an eight-legged sausage dog, Bongo the rabbit from Life in Hell and a tiny giraffe in a birdcage. He doesn't like any of them.] Just give me your best animal.
	Salesman #2	Best? Well that's a matter of opinion. I personally like the Electric Snail.
	Fry	That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
	Salesman #2	The lizards are a buck each, the parrot is $500.
	Fry	That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
	Salesman #2	Sir, the store is closing in two minutes.
	Fry	Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!
	Fry	Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you. [The parrot squawks.] Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you? [It squawks again.] Shut the hell up! [It bites his nose.] Ow! [He drops the cage and the parrot flies out.] Stupid bird! I know where you live.
	Amy	Hey, it's Leela.
	Leela	Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Huh? You were gone?
	Leela	It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
	Hermes	I hear that! I aks him to set the table, instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog.
	Leela	Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
	Zoidberg	Why?
	Leela	I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
	Fry	Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal.
	Fry	Aha! Cornered!
	Leela	Hi, there!
	Fry	Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!
	Leela	You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.
	Fry	I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family.
	Leela	It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together.
	Fry	Merry Xmas, Leela.
	Leela	Merry Xmas.
	Fry	Oh, boy! It's Santa!
	Santa	Ho, ho, ho! [Fry and Leela back away.] You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list.
	Fry	Well check it twice!
	Santa	I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings.
	Leela	But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
	Santa	But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?
	Fry	No! I swear!
	Santa	Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!
	Robots	[singing] So lock the door and hit the floor,'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.
	Hattie	Go away!
	Bender	Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?
	Hattie	Oh, alright. But just one glass! [The robots go inside and she closes the door. We hear the robots guzzling down the cider.] [from inside] OK, that's enough. [They carry on drinking.] I said that's enough!
	Bender	[from inside] Get her purse!
	Fry	Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
	Santa	You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!
	Leela	We're trapped.
	Fry	I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!
	Leela	Goodbye, Fry.
	Fry	Goodbye, Leela. [They hug.] Hey, look, we're under the mistletoe.
	Santa	Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!
	Fry	Uh, you're present may need some assembly.
	Bender	[singing] On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
	Robot #1	[singing] Four family photos.
	Tinny Tim	[singing] Three jars of pennies.
	Robot #2	[singing] Two former husbands.
	Bender	[singing] And a slipper on a shoe tree.
	Raoul	Oh, thank you!
	Fry	[shouting] Help!
	Leela	[shouting] Somebody help us.
	Tinny Tim	It's humans. Shall we mug them, robot sir?
	Bender	No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.
	Santa	Ho, ho, ho! [Bender panics.] You've been very naughty, Bender.
	Bender	What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
	Santa	My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now. [He pulls a list out and starts writing.] Framing ... I-N-G ... [The robots, Fry and Leela run away.] ... an...
	Zoidberg	Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair.
	Amy	Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes.
	Hermes	Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg.
	Zoidberg	Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair. [He pulls his hat off. Amy's and Hermes' hair is grafted to his head.] Finally I look as pretty as I feel!
	Fry	[shouting; from outside] Help!
	Leela	[shouting; from outside] Help!
	Bender	[shouting; from outside] Help!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
	Hermes	Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! [Fry and Leela run over to the cover and start to push it. It moves very slowly.] Push! Push!
	Bender	Use teamwork!
	Tinny Tim	Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
	Santa	You've all been very naughty, very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg, this is for you.
	Zoidberg	A pogo-stick!
	Santa	As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and deck the halls with your guts.
	Bender	Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you. [Santa whacks Bender over the head with his sack.] Ow! God! The pain!
	Santa	Ho, ho, ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!
	Leela	Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
	Amy	Rudolph's nose!
	Fry	[shouting] He's gonna blow!
	Zoidberg	Aha!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!
	Bender	Xmas dinner, everyone.
	Fry	Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?
	Bender	I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.
	Tinny Tim	Thank you, sir.
	Bender	You got the toenail! [Nibbler eats the rest of the parrot and snatches Tinny Tim's piece off his plate.] Oh!
	Fry	Look, the food isn't what's important.
	Tinny Tim	I'm so hungry.
	Fry	The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!
	Amy	[singing] He knows when you are sleeping.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[singing] He knows when you're on the can.
	Leela	[singing] He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
	Zoidberg	[singing] Oh.
	Hermes	[singing] You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move.
	Bender	[singing] You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.
	Fry	[singing] Santa Claus is gunning you down!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Merry Xmas, everyone!
	Santa	[over credits] I'll be back. Back when you least expect it: Next Xmas! Ho, ho, ho!
