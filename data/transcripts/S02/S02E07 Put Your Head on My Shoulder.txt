	Lincoln	[on TV] Four score and 1145 years ago our forefathers' foreheads conceived a new nation.
	Washington	[on TV] And this Presidents' Day we honoureth those values that my body fought and died for.
	Malfunctioning Eddie	[on TV] Values like this brand new Plymouth V'Ger! Hi, I'm Malfunctioning Eddie and I'm malfunctioning so badly I'm practically giving these cars away!
	Amy	Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!
	Bender	Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing. [He picks up a recall notice.] The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
	Fry	No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
	Leela	I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.
	Victor	Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on beautiful women.
	Leela	Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
	Victor	Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first. [He takes Amy over to a car.] This is the Beta Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates.
	Salesman	Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty.
	Fry	Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright.
	Salesman	No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird! [He takes Fry over to a car.] Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?
	Fry	Sorry, I'm not here to buy.
	Salesman	I understand, and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation.
	Fry	I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
	Salesman	One word: Thundercougarfalconbird!
	Victor	The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the beaks of a thousand eagles. Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards.
	Amy	That's an awful lot of eagle.
	Victor	Yes, and yet--
	Amy	What's wrong?
	Victor	It is just ... the luxury edition has so much more eagle. It saddens me to think of you missing out.
	Amy	Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich.
	Mechanic	I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure.
	Bender	You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory.
	Mechanic	Alright. But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow, and when it does, I just pray you're not moonin' someone you care about.
	Amy	Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said so.
	Victor	[quietly; to himself] No dog food for Victor tonight.
	Leela	OK, the sticker says 55,000, but we'll only go as high as, say--
	Amy	60,000!
	Victor	Oh, I will have to ask my manager.
	Leela	Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price.
	Amy	I thought it was an auction.
	Victor	He is not too happy.
	Amy	I'm sorry. 80,000?
	Amy	Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.
	Hermes	[from inside] And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight! [Fry and Leela look at each other and shrug.] You're bogarting my patience.
	Leela	Hermes, who were you yelling at?
	Hermes	Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off, but I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans.
	Fry	Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well, since neither of us has a date, why don't we...?
	Leela	You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
	Fry	Shall we say eight o'clock?
	Amy	Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?
	Fry	Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?
	Amy	The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava.
	Fry	So, what? Shorts?
	Fry	Boy, this A.C. is incredible! [He shivers.] I'd better turn on the heater too. [He does and the fuel gauge starts to go down. They pass Hg's Fuel, the only fuel station on the planet.] [shouting] Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more.
	Amy	[shouting] Hey, how about some icy margaritas?
	Fry	[shouting] Yeah! [He pushes a button and two glasses and a mixer comes out. The fuel gauge drops further.] We're slowing down!
	Amy	[shouting] Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
	Fry	[shouting] Who wants pop-tarts? [He puts the pop-tarts in the toaster and turns it on full. The engine stops, the heater and A.C. go off, the mixer stops and the car jerks to a halt, then falls to the ground. Amy gasps and sees the fuel gauge is empty. Fry takes his shades off and sees the sign to Hg's Fuel; 4750 miles one way, 4750 miles the other way.] Uh-oh!
	Amy	It's OK, I have an emergency phone.
	Fry	What are you doing?
	Amy	Spluh! It's a video-phone. [She presses a button on the steering wheel and a screen and dialling pad fold out. She dials.] Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association. [A man appears on the screen.] Hello? Septuple-A?
	Fry	Phew!
	Amy	It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit.
	Fry	Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
	Amy	I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. [She scoffs.] As though!
	Fry	I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?
	Amy	Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, "Straighten your Pope hat," and, "Put on your good vestments." [Fry laughs then Amy joins in.] You know, Fry, it's nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk.
	Fry	Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever.
	Amy	So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?
	Fry	Yeah.
	Hermes	Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business?
	All	[simultaneous] No.
	Hermes	Any new business?
	All	[simultaneous] No.
	Hermes	Anyone spend the night together?
	Amy	Yep.
	Fry	Kind of.
	Bender	What?
	Hermes	Oh, my God!
	Amy	We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
	Fry	And it led there again when we got home.
	Bender	Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics.
	Leela	Bender! Romance isn't about money.
	Bender	Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!
	Leela	For your information, it's because he's hideous.
	Hermes	Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
	Professor Farnsworth	Do I hear wedding bells?
	Fry	What? No!
	Professor Farnsworth	Really? Oh, dear.
	Zoidberg	You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
	Bender	Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
	Judge	$500 and time served.
	Bender	Stupid anti-pimping laws! [He turns to Leela.] Well, pay the man!
	Hookerbot	Bender, honey, we love you!
	Bender	Shut up, baby, I know it!
	Bender	Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head".
	Leela	Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?
	Bender	Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
	Hermes	[shouting] Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on! I need a stapler.
	Zoidberg	Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
	Fry	[whispering] It's working, they think we're making out. [They laugh then juggle.] Wait, why aren't we making out?
	Amy	I 'unno.
	Bender	OK, Mister...?
	Zapp	Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan.
	Bender	Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
	Zapp	Let's see ... Oh, yes! [He punches out a hole.] Yes, definitely. [He punches out another.] Oh, I'd like some of that. [Another one.] Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu.
	Bender	Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier. [He screws up the sheet and throws it in his chest cabinet and imitates a computer by beeping. He then pulls out a random sheet and hands it to Zapp.] Say hello to Miss Right!
	Zapp	[sexfully] Hello!
	Fry	Wow! We're great kissers!
	Amy	Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter.
	Fry	Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk.
	Amy	Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you.
	Fry	Everything was going great. Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hanging out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.
	Leela	You'll be back to zero soon enough.
	Fry	Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
	Amy	Hi.
	Fry	You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
	Leela	Fry--
	Fry	I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!
	Leela	I think you're over reacting.
	Fry	Am I? [shouting] Am I? [talking] Face it, I'm a prize catch. [He belches.] I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money.
	Leela	Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.
	Fry	Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us. I can't be alone with her.
	Amy	So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?
	Fry	Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me? [He looks over Amy's shoulder at Leela. She shakes her head.] Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.
	Zoidberg	Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
	Zoidberg	Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ... [He gobbles down the food.] ... dry woven reeds! [He eats the basket.] All gone! Can I drive?
	Amy	No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight.
	Fry	Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?
	Amy	OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?
	Fry	Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?
	Amy	But you just said--
	Fry	That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.
	Zoidberg	Wahoo!
	Fry	[from inside] Pardon me, excuse me.
	Zoidberg	Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!
	Fry	Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?
	Amy	Huh? You don't like chocolate?
	Fry	Look, could chocolate just let me finish?
	Zoidberg	Vroom, vroom! And the winner of the big car race is ... Hot Rod Zoidberg!
	Fry	Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--
	Zoidberg	Uh-oh. Here, you drive!
	Zoidberg	Fry? Are you alright?
	Fry	Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
	Zoidberg	No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash.
	Fry	How badly?
	Zoidberg	That's it over there. [He points to Fry's headless body. Fry screams.] Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery.
	Fry	Where is it?
	Zoidberg	There.
	Amy	Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!
	Leela	This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
	Zoidberg	Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days. [He lifts Fry's body up over his shoulder.] Upsy daisy!
	Fry	Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much.
	Amy	Fry!
	Fry	Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.
	Amy	So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?
	Fry	Oh, that. [He turns and sees Farnsworth sweeping behind them.] Maybe we'd better talk in private. [whispering] I'll meet you in the closet.
	Fry	Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together.
	Amy	You're breaking up with me?
	Fry	I just think we should start seeing other people.
	Amy	But, I was really having fun. [She sighs.] If that's how you feel.
	Fry	I'm sorry, but it is.
	Amy	Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?
	Fry	Huh?
	Amy	I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel.
	Fry	Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!
	Amy	With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
	Fry	[happy] Oh! [disappointed] Oh!
	Leela	So, how's business?
	Bender	Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day.
	Leela	Yeah, it's pathetic alright! [She whistles. Bender hums.] How much?
	Bender	500 bucks.
	Leela	Done.
	Bender	Zapp Brannigan OK?
	Leela	No!
	Bender	600.
	Fry	Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute? [He turns to Amy.] In private?
	Amy	Oh, no problem.
	Fry	This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?
	Leela	You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!
	Fry	Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
	Leela	Bender's in his office.
	Fry	Thanks.
	Bender	I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance.
	Amy	OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.
	Fry	Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
	Amy	What business is it of yours?
	Fry	And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
	Amy	This is deodorant.
	Fry	What does it do?
	Amy	[shouting] C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes.
	Gary	[from outside] I'll be waiting.
	Fry	20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
	Amy	Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little.
	Fry	Oh, God, it's true!
	Gary	That dress looks great on you.
	Amy	[simultaneous] Thanks.
	Fry	[simultaneous] Thanks. [He watches the door.] Where is she?
	Gary	I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?
	Amy	Mm-mm.
	Fry	I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
	Bender	Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!
	Petunia	How's them eats?
	Fry	Uh--
	Petunia	Don't mind if I do. [She puts the hamburger into her handbag.] Kids'll be hungry.
	Fry	[whispering] She seems a little old for me.
	Bender	She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
	Petunia	Wheels fell off my house.
	Bender	Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
	Gary	I'll take one.
	Fry	Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.
	Bender	Eight bucks.
	Fry	But you just said--
	Bender	Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!
	Bender	Leela, meet your future husband Sal.
	Sal	Nice eyeball, eyeball.
	Leela	Nice ass, ass.
	Bender	Ooh, sparks! [whispering] Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!
	Sal	Eh, I'll take my chances.
	Zapp	Cheers!
	"Woman"	Cheers!
	Petunia	So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?
	Fry	Well, ma'am, I--
	Petunia	What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.
	Fry	No, but I control this arm.
	Petunia	Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better.
	Fry	Wait, come back, uh, darling.
	Petunia	Can't, hon', I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump.
	Sal	So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but that 10:15 to Nutley ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly behinds the wheel.
	Petunia	Excuse me, did you say "10:15 to Nutley"?
	Sal	Why, yes I dids.
	Leela	[whispering] Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
	Bender	Of course not.
	Sal	[shouting] Anybodys else for Nutley?
	Zapp	Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise.
	Gary	[whispering] You know what I'd like to do...?
	Fry	Oh, jeez, get a room!
	Gary	Maybe later.
	Fry	Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream.
	Gary	Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee.
	Amy	I don't really like coffee.
	Gary	Neither do I.
	Amy	Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!
	Gary	Let me pick up the check.
	Fry	Nooo! [Gary drops his card onto the check.] That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here. [He tugs at his head.] Ooh! Ow!
	Leela	Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry.
	Fry	Oh, Leela!
	Amy	We were just on our way out.
	Leela	Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?
	Gary	I'm a banking industry regulator.
	Leela	Really? Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.
	Gary	Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical.
	Leela	Oh, I do.
	Gary	It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...
	Fry	[whispering] Thank you.
	Zoidberg	There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin. I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash.
	Fry	Can I live without it?
	Zoidberg	If you call that living.
	Professor Farnsworth	I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. [He sighs.] But I guess we're just two different people.
	Fry	So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff.
	Amy	It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you.
	Fry	Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.
	Leela	So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
	Fry	Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender. [He touches his neck and kicks himself.] Ow! Cool! [He does it again.] Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night.
	Leela	Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
	Bender	Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
	Leela	Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
	Bender	Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
	Leela	No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
	Bender	True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?
	Leela	Yeah.
	Fry	I guess so. [Bender laughs and puts his arms around Fry and Leela and pats them.] Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
	Bender	My ass! My beautiful ass!
