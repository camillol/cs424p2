	Bender	Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is-- No, this one. Wait ... that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far, so good on this one.
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] And now, here he is: Chef, restaurateur, author of Cooking Slugs For Dinner and Cooking Dinner For Slugs ... Elzar!
	Bender	Yeah! [Above them Elzar flies in on a jet pack and lands at the back of the studio.] Alright! Yeah, yeah, baby!
	Man	Elzar! [Elzar passes a centipede-like alien wearing a "Knock It Up A Notch" T-shirt.] Alright!
	Bender	Elzar, you're my God. Please sign this sketch I drew of you. [He holds up a crude picture of himself staring lovey-eyed at Elzar. Elzar takes it stamps "I'll Sign This For $50.00. x___" on it and hands it back to Bender.] [crying] Oh, Elzar! Bless you!
	Elzar	Now this is why I prefer your non-stick robots.
	Bender	[disappointed] Oh. [The audience claps and cheers.] [normal] Alright, yeah! [The "Applause" sign changes to "Less Applause".] [quietly] Alright, yeah!
	Elzar	Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food. [Bender hoots.] 'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo.
	Bender	[loudly] Boiled? Interesting.
	Leela	[whispering] Bender, please try to be a little quieter.
	Bender	No, you shut up.
	Elzar	Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from your spice weasel. [He takes one out and squeezes it.] Bam!
	Bender	Oh, yeah! Bam it again, Elzar! Knock it up another notch!
	Elzar	Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?
	Bender	Come on, you wimp! Work that weasel! Quit holding out on us.
	Elzar	If you promise to stop interrupting, alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch.
	Bender	I gotta get this notch-up-knocking on film. [He stands up.] Hey, Elzar, think fast.
	Elzar	What, huh?
	Leela	Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
	Bender	Bam!
	Hattie	Tell me, doctor, how's my cyst?
	Taco Bellevue Doctor	Grande.
	Zoidberg	I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated.
	Doctor #2	OK. What does this look like to you?
	Leela	Um ... a grey-ish blob?
	Doctor #2	Right. [He swaps the blob with a picture of a toucan playing tennis.] And this one?
	Leela	Um ... a grey-ish blob?
	Doctor #2	Not as right that time. It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation.
	Zoidberg	Nice try, little boy. You may have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace!
	Doctor #2	You seem a bit tense. [He tips some pills onto his hand.] Here, try these.
	Zoidberg	Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work, sonny! [He slurps the pills off the doctor's hand and his pupils dilate.] [high] Why always the fighting?
	Doctor #2	Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about a week.
	Leela	A week? What do you think, Dr. Zoidberg?
	Zoidberg	[high] Clack.
	Zoidberg	[high] Thanks for the help, Leela.
	Amy	[shouting] Leela, we're right here.
	Leela	I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
	Fry	No! In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too.
	Bender	It's Elzar again! Oh, my God, I'm so excited, I wish I could wet my pants!
	Elzar	Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget.
	Amy	[cheering] Alright!
	Fry	[cheering] Yeah!
	Bender	[cheering] Hooray for blind-y!
	Zoidberg	Oh, God! I'm coming down!
	Elzar	Folks, tell the neighbours to watch your mouth 'cause your taste buds are going on vacation. I made you each your own special meal, so dig in!
	Hermes	It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen. Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?
	Zoidberg	The king crab is to die for. Look! A tiny edible crown.
	Amy	What's it made of?
	Zoidberg	[eating] Wood!
	Bender	Oh, Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!
	Fry	No, thanks. That's robot food.
	Bender	It's so good. Oh, just try a little!
	Fry	No, really, I don't-- [Bender stuffs a spoonful in his mouth and he screams as his tongue catches fire. The flame goes out and Fry tastes it and smiles.] Mmm!
	Amy	Are you doing alright over there, Leela?
	Leela	Oh, yeah, this salad's fantastic. [She takes a forkful of flowers from the middle of the table.] So fresh.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me.
	Elzar	Everybody enjoy their dinner?
	Leela	Are you kidding me?
	Amy	Uh-huh.
	Bender	God, yes, Elzar.
	Elzar	Well, I enjoyed cooking for you. And to make everything completely square, I want you to have these complimentary after-dinner chocolates.
	Hermes	What's this under the chocolates?
	Elzar	Yeah, you take care of that whenever you want.
	Hermes	Hey.
	Amy	A bill?
	Leela	You're charging us? After you blinded me?
	Elzar	Hey, I made you a nice meal. This ain't a charity.
	Fry	$1200?
	Professor Farnsworth	Holy Zombie Jesus!
	Hermes	We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg.
	Zoidberg	They took away my credit card.
	Elzar	OK, OK, wait. I know how to take care of this, no problem.
	URL	You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame.
	Smitty	He's making a break for it. Get him!
	Fry	No! No! I was just picking my nose.
	Smitty	He's picking his nose. Get him!
	Smitty	The old dine-and-dash, huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks like you who kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop.
	URL	Now it's payback time. Aw, yeah!
	Zoidberg	Please don't hit me. I'm brittle!
	Bender	Hey, wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
	Zoidberg	Listen to the smart robot.
	Bender	I love cooking and Elzar's ass loves getting kissed, right?
	Elzar	No question.
	Bender	So, how 'bout I work part-time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?
	Elzar	I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable.
	Hermes	Oh, Bender's a model employee.
	Amy	He's so polite.
	Leela	And hard-working.
	Fry	He's made of candy.
	Elzar	OK, fine, I'll give it a shot.
	Fry	[cheering] Alright!
	Hermes	[cheering] Yes!
	Bender	Hot diggety!
	Smitty	You'd better keep your nose clean.
	Bender	That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
	Hermes	Ah! Time for my precious 10am meeting. [He looks around the table.] Where in Legoland is Leela?
	Leela	I'm here and I'm getting along just fine, thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.
	Amy	Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do your makeup.
	Leela	I don't need help. For your information I did this all by myself.
	Professor Farnsworth	You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso.
	Bender	Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone.
	Professor Farnsworth	Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you. [He gets up and heads for the door.] Some kind of gamma-powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal...
	Bender	Well, if that new guy can't handle things, gimme a call.
	Bender	I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint. [He takes a mint from a bowl and leaves grease over the rest of them.] So, uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?
	Elzar	Bam!
	Bender	[muttering] Bam yourself! [The door opens and three robots walk in. One of them is short, has a scar on his face and clamps instead of hands, another wears a hat, cloak and carries a cane and the third, the tallest, wears a chain around his neck with a computer mouse attached to it. The lead robot hands his hat to the one with the clamps and his cloak to the one with the mouse. A waitress shows them through.] [talking] Hey, who are they?
	Elzar	Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions.
	Bender	Are they the Robot Mafia?
	Elzar	Yes.
	Donbot	You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over the head with this table.
	Clamps	You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you. You wanna be clamped?
	Joey	Whoa! Whoa! Calm down, Clamps. [He turns to the waitress.] The boss, he likes a wall up which his back can be put against. Such as like this there.
	Waitress	But that table's already--
	Bender	Ah, let me bus that for you, gentlemen. [He walks over to the table and pulls the tablecloth away, leaving the plates and glasses undisturbed. The family applauds.] No, what I meant to do was--
	Woman	Oh!
	Man	I can't believe this!
	Bender	Mind your own business and get out!
	Donbot	Huh. I like this guy's lack of style.
	Clamps	So I finally get this guy a pair of cement shoes which he likes 'cause they're lighter than his lead ones.
	Donbot	Hey! You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred.
	Bender	No, you gave me a fifty.
	Donbot	Oh, no I didn't.
	Bender	Yeah, you did.
	Clamps	Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?
	Bender	I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
	Donbot	Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you, kid. Here's something for your trouble. [He slips something into Bender's apron pocket.] [whispering] It's money.
	Bender	Wow! Thanks.
	Donbot	Hey, you earned that 50 bucks.
	Bender	You gave me a twenty.
	Donbot	I did? [He starts counting out some extra cash.] Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to-- Hey, wait a minute. [He laughs.] I got a good feeling about you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?
	Bender	Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning! [He takes off his apron, screws it up and throws it on the floor.] [shouting] Hey, Elzar! I quit!
	Elzar	[shouting; from foyer] K.
	Donbot	We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a, uh, private lottery that we run.
	Bender	Wow, you guys run numbers?
	Clamps	Well, nothing fancy, y'know. Ones and zeros mostly.
	Donbot	Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy "The Mechanical Bull" Gravano. And watch out for the cops.
	Bender	That's just what my mom used to tell me.
	Bender	That's some fine oil-ade, son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia, which I'm sorta in.
	Tinny Tim	You flatter me, kind goon. But I'm only programmed to sell oil-ade and write in cute backwards letters like on the sign here.
	Bender	Aw, crap! The cops!
	Smitty	Seen any suspicious activity?
	URL	Nope. But check out today's Marmaduke. Solid!
	Smitty	Hey! It's that skell from Elzar's.
	URL	Undercover pursuit in progress ... baby.
	Smitty	Gotcha!
	Bender	What seems to be the problem, officers? Was I speeding?
	Smitty	We'll decide what you were doing after an illegal search.
	URL	He's clean. [He closes the door.] Smells nice too.
	Smitty	Better than me?
	URL	Aw, yeah.
	Tinny Tim	Courtesy of Mr. Bender.
	Donbot	Nice job, Bender. You passed the test. You wanna join me, Clamps and Joey Mouse Pad at our, uh, social club tomorrow night?
	Bender	Uh, I'd rather plan some felonies.
	Donbot	Oh. Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters.
	Robot	Donbot, I beg you, I can't make this week's loan payment. Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file.
	Donbot	File not found. [Clamps and Joey take out some laser-Tommy guns and shoot the robot, riddling him with laser holes. He screams and falls to the floor.] Let that be a warning to you.
	Robot	Thank you, Donbot.
	Bender	Joey! Clamps! Donny B!
	Donbot	Hey, listen, Bender. We got a big score planned but, uh, we need some muscle.
	Bender	A little of this, huh?
	Joey	Ho! Ho! This guy's an ox! He's got oxon-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname, right? Let's call him Clamps.
	Clamps	Clamps? That's my name, you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!
	Bender	How 'bout "Blotto"? It's gritty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers.
	Joey	Good thinking. Hey, hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk in the tea park, alright? There may be some death killing.
	Clamps	It's gonna be clamp this, clamp that. Bada-climp, bada-clamp!
	Donbot	What d'you think, Blotto? You in?
	Bender	It's funny: Until now I always wanted to be a gangster ... so the answer's yes.
	Clamps	Yeah!
	Joey	Hey, hey! Way to go, way to be, way to shoot!
	Donbot	Now, since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi.
	Bender	An alibi, huh?
	Bender	[groaning; from quarters] I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.
	Fry	But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes.
	Bender	[groaning; from quarters] I can't move.
	Bender	[groaning; on tape] Oh, I think I'm gonna output.
	Fry	[from outside] OK, you stay in bed. I'll eat yours.
	Fry	Bender's sick. [Leela presses the button and the ship rises into its 45-degree launch position. Fry eats a sundae and talks with his mouth full.] Need any help taking off?
	Leela	I'm fine, thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
	Hermes	That's coming outta your pay!
	Bender	You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good, high-quality oil ... then eat it. So what's this big score anyway?
	Donbot	We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
	Bender	Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
	Joey	Yo! There's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns.
	Donbot	Alright, here's the battle plan: We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard, somebody does some clamping, then we heist the cigars and go home.
	Bender	And all without killing anyone. [He whistles.] This gang's got some fresh, new ideas. I admire that.
	Joey	Oh, we'll kill 'em alright.
	Clamps	We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!
	Fry	Wow! It's too bad you can't see, Leela, 'cause there's a cool ship out there shooting at somebody.
	Leela	I'm taking evasive action.
	Fry	Uh, Leela?
	Leela	Stop bothering me, Fry, I need full concentration.
	Computer Voice	Missile evaded.
	Leela	Eyesight is for chumps.
	Donbot	Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey, Blotto, roll down the window and start shooting.
	Bender	Um, uh, um. [He opens the window, leans out and pretends to fire the gun, making the noises. He looks back in at Donbot who doesn't turn around. He makes an explosion sound.] [fake hurt] Ooh! Ow! He got me! Ooh! What a shot that guy is!
	Leela	Wait! Why do the raised letters that normally say "Turn Master Steering Wheel Company" say "Nibbler"? Oh, no!
	Leela	[on screen] I'm back at the wheel, Fry. Everything's under control.
	Fry	Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance!
	Joey	They're coming straight toward our proximity. Maybe you should give 'em the clamps, Clamps.
	Clamps	Gee, you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I use every day at every opportunity? [shouting] You're a freaking genius, you idiot!
	Leela	The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
	Donbot	Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars.
	Leela	You'll never get away with this.
	Fry	Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
	Donbot	Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more.
	Joey	Hey, boss, looks like somebody beat us to it.
	Leela	I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Hi-yah!
	Donbot	Hey, where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade.
	Bender	Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich.
	Donbot	Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
	Bender	Capital idea, old sport. [He ties Fry to chair. Nibbler tugs his leg and points at the mobbots.] I say, get the hell off me!
	Leela	[whispering] That guy sounds familiar.
	Bender	My word, what have we-- [He gasps. Leela stares at him. She can just about make out Bender's shape but he puts the eye patch back on her.] Uh, nothing to see here, old girl.
	Joey	Hey, boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here.
	Donbot	Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him.
	Fry	No!
	Clamps	I got a little surprise in store for that guy: The clamps! Eh?
	Bender	Uh, wait, old ... spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer.
	Fry	[whispering] Oh, no! Poor Bender.
	Bender	[groaning; on tape; from quarters] Oh, I don't feel good.
	Bender	[from quarters] Chew on this! [normal voice] Ooh, ah! [fake voice] What ho! [normal voice] Stop it!
	Bender	[fake voice] Take that, you twit. [normal voice] No! Stop it!
	Donbot	That's the last of 'em. [Joey and Clamps walk back in through the linkway.] Alright, now let's Mafia things up a little. [He takes two oil containers out of his chest cabinet.] Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
	Bender	Uh, hey, Donny, baby, gimme a chance here, huh? Yous guys skedaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik.
	Donbot	Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get you your own pair of clamps, huh?
	Clamps	[muttering] He's gonna get clamps? Clamps, clamps ... [He and Joey leave.] ... clamps, clamps!
	Bender	Phew!
	Fry	Leela, we may not have much time left ... [Bender sneaks past them to an empty chair.] ... so let's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender. He was like a big computer that ran on magic.
	Bender	Uh, help! Help!
	Leela	Bender!
	Fry	You're OK!
	Bender	Yes, I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
	Leela	I've got an idea. Hold still. [She rubs her ropes against Bender's arm.] It's about to break. Yes! Yes!
	Leela	[cheering] Alright!
	Bender	Yeah that broke, alright!
	Fry	I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt.
	Leela	Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my eye patch off.
	Zoidberg	I'll handle the snipping. After all, I do have the proper equipment.
	Leela	I think it's Blotto, that gangster I saw when my patch fell off. [Bender rubs some sweat off his head with Nibbler. Leela focuses. The shape turns into Farnsworth.] Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?
	Professor Farnsworth	Where am I now?
	Bender	So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
	Tinny Tim	Fine kick, sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist.
	Bender	Oh, sweet legal tender! [He takes the cash and starts to eat it.] Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind.
	Fry	It's funny, Bender; with you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
	Bender	And maybe someday I won't listen.
