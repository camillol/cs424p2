	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it "the fing-longer". [He is wearing a glove with a long index finger.] Observe. [He pulls out a rest and aims the fing-longer at a button on a piece of equipment.] And, here we go. [He misses the button a few times but eventually succeeds. The equipment, a sort of TV screen, turns on.] There!
	Fry	Ooh!
	Amy	Wow!
	Zoidberg	Ah!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Pretty long, eh?
	Fry	Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen.
	Fry	Does it really work?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Of course it works! [He bashes Fry on the nose with the fing-longer.] It's just not very long.
	Bender	Ooh! Ooh! [He rubs his hands together.] I wanna aks it a question! [He speaks into the the microphone of the What-If machine.] As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered: What if I was 500-feet tall?
	Zoidberg	Let's watch, shall we?
	Bender	My work here is done!
	Fry	I'm so lonely since I came to the future. [He pulls out a slice of bread and offers it to a duck.] Will you be my friend? [The duck snatches away the bread and bites him.] Ow! [A shadow creeps over him. He looks up and Bender falls on him. Bender groans and sits up. Fry is wedged between his eyes. Fry gasps.] Who are you?
	Bender	I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
	Fry	You too? Will you be my friend?
	Bender	Put it there, pal! [Fry shakes his finger.] I meant your wallet.
	Bender	Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes. [The troops shoot him with electricity guns.] Hey! [They shoot again and Bender just laughs.] [laughing] Aw, quit it! Come on!
	Fry	[shouting] Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--
	Zapp	Uh--
	Amy	Well, there goes the neighbourhood. [Bender smashes some more buildings.] There goes another neighbourhood.
	Hermes	We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
	Zoidberg	What's this? Two meals in one week?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Gotcha!
	Hermes	Oh, yes!
	Zoidberg	Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me! [Farnsworth throws a switch and the enlarging ray comes down and enlarges Zoidberg.] What?
	Zoidberg	So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city? [He walks towards a building.] Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you? [He growls and knocks the building in half. He turns around.] Ah, the famed Apollo Theater. "Boo" me off stage on open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!
	Bender	Hey, I called this city! Quit touching my stuff!
	Zoidberg	Tell it to claw.
	Bender	Bite my colossal metal ass!
	Zoidberg	Stop!
	Bender	[shouting] Who wants lobster bisque?
	Zoidberg	Hmm?
	Fry	Hey, Bender?
	Bender	Huh?
	Fry	Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
	Bender	Who put this in here?
	Fry	[screaming] Nooo! [He climbs onto Bender.] [talking] Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying! And we'll never even know why he came.
	Bender	I'll tell you ... with my final breath. [The crowd murmurs.] I came here with a simple dream: A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I. [He chokes.] Not I.
	Fry	Goodnight, sweet prince.
	Narrator	[voice-over] Interesting stuff. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?
	Leela	Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about.
	Hermes	Come on, woman! Just pick something.
	Fry	Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.
	Bender	Go, man! Go!
	Leela	I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while. [Fry hums and chops a banana onto his head.] Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little. [Farnsworth pushes a button with the fing-longer.] Not too much.
	Leela	Hey, you guys, look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone. [He drops the meat into a pit in the middle of the room. In the pit three giant anteaters eat it.] The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela.
	Leela	Hello? New boots!
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive.
	Leela	Yah!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[shouting] Ooh! [The anteaters start to eat him.] Oh, you've killed me! You've killed me!
	Leela	Oh, God! What have I done?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I just told you, you've killed me!
	Leela	OK, just try to be nonchalant.
	Zoidberg	Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it.
	Hermes	Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!
	Zoidberg	What?
	Hermes	If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I flush some things.
	Zoidberg	Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy. [He puts on a deerstalker and pulls out a magnifying glass.] Zoidberg is afoot!
	Hermes	Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up. [reading] "Citation for public nudity", "Conspiracy to commit public nudity". [talking] Aha! A new will! Naming ... [He gasps.] ... you as his sole heir.
	Leela	That doesn't prove I killed him.
	Hermes	It's a video will. It shows you killing him.
	Leela	[from meeting room] Hi-yah!
	Zoidberg	Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting? [Hermes dives into the room but is dragged out again.] Is it anteater number two? [Leela runs in, grabs an axe and runs out again.] Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name! [An anteater makes a noise.] What? How do you spell that?
	Hermes	[shouting; from meeting room] What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My precious torso!
	Zoidberg	[shouting] Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things.
	Bender	Whattya got? Disposal trouble?
	Leela	No! Everything's just--
	Bender	Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?. [He starts clearing the garbage disposal.] And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm? Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!
	Leela	I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?
	Bender	Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
	Leela	You're blackmailing me?
	Bender	"Blackmail" is such an ugly word. I prefer "extortion". The "X" makes it sound cool. [Leela narrows her eye and pulls out a meat cleaver.] Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?
	Leela	OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum. [She sighs.] Now to dispose of the body.
	Amy	Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all.
	Leela	Do you have any gum?
	Amy	No.
	Zoidberg	Ah, the gang's all here.
	Leela	Who are you?
	Scruffy	Scruffy, the janitor.
	Leela	I've never seen you before.
	Scruffy	I've never seen you before neither.
	Zoidberg	Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer! [Everyone except Leela gasps. She gasps theatrically.] You see, the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor's lab coat.
	Leela	Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. [She unzips her boots and lifts her feet onto the table and twiddles her toes.] See?
	Fry	Ew! What smells like boot feet?
	Cubert	This is preposterous. Obviously, the murderer is--
	Zoidberg	My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse.
	Scruffy	Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--
	Zoidberg	So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable! [Nibbler squeals and points at Leela. The lights go off and Leela stabs Nibbler. They come back on and Nibbler is sandwiched between Scruffy and Cubert. An envelope comes through the door. Zoidberg reads the letter inside.] A letter from Bender, my good friend. [reading] Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was-- [He looks up from the letter.] My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--
	Fry	I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.
	Leela	Could you get the lights on your way out?
	Fry	Whatcha eating?
	Leela	[eating] Lobster. Want some?
	Fry	Sure. [He picks up one of Zoidberg's claws, dips it in sauce and takes a bite.] Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths.
	Leela	Really?
	Fry	Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
	Leela	No.
	Fry	No?
	Leela	No!
	Fry	Then ... then ... it was you!
	Leela	[crying] I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
	Fry	Well, that covers the first three killings.
	Leela	And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!
	Leela	So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?
	Fry	I like it!
	Leela	Good. Now let me just get the lights.
	Fry	I really like it!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
	Fry	Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?
	Leela	You idiot! We already saw that.
	Fry	I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
	Prof. Farnsworth	We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
	Fry	Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?
	Prof. Farnsworth	That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way. [He turns to the What-If machine.] What would happen if Fry never came to the future?
	Fry	Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! [He sits down in the chair, puts his feet on the desk and opens a can of beer.] Here's to another lousy Millennium! [He blows the noise maker and tips back on the chair. He loses his balance, falls and hits his head on a freezer.] Ow! [The dial on the machine sets itself. He rubs his head and holds up the noise maker.] I should have left you floating in the toilet!
	Leela	What is it?
	Prof. Farnsworth	It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
	Bender	Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!
	Fry	Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
	Zoidberg	If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!
	Fry	You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?
	Mr. Panucci	There's only three real monsters, kid: Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong. Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough! [Fry sighs. Stephen Hawking rolls in.] Hey! The usual, Professor Hawking?
	Stephen Hawking	No. Today I'd like something good.
	Mr. Panucci	Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!
	Fry	Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
	Stephen Hawking	Sure. Why not?
	Fry	Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it? [Hawking's eyes widen in horror.] 'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it "a Fry Hole".
	Stephen Hawking	There is nothing to be concerned about. I must go. There is much to do.
	Mr. Panucci	Hey, Hawking! Your pizza's ready.
	Stephen Hawking	Toss it in the garbage!
	Stephen Hawking	[from alley] There he is. Seize him.
	Fry	[from alley] Who said that? [A man in a long coat and a woman with a beehive cast shadows on a wall. They start beating Fry.] Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
	Fry	Who are you people?
	Al Gore	I'm Al Gore, and these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; a group of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum.
	Fry	I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
	Al Gore	That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the Constitution!
	Fry	Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
	Al Gore	Very much so. But first, meet the Action Rangers. You already know Stephen Hawking. Also with us are Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a. Commander Uhura.
	Nichols	Incoming transmission from MCI "One Rate" department. It sounds like a limited-time offer.
	Al Gore	Tell them I'm in the tub! To my left you'll recognise Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons & Dragons.
	Gygax	Greetings! It's a ... [He rolls some dice.] ... pleasure to meet you!
	Al Gore	And our summer intern, Deep Blue, the world's foremost chess-playing computer.
	Deep Blue	Bishop to knight 4.
	Al Gore	Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll understand that.
	Fry	Where am I, anyway?
	Nichols	You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module.
	Gygax	A school bus!
	Fry	So what do you nerds want?
	Nichols	It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
	Stephen Hawking	I call it a "Hawking Hole".
	Fry	No fair! I saw it first!
	Stephen Hawking	Who is The Journal of Quantum Physics going to believe?
	Gygax	Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation.
	Nichols	That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
	Al Gore	If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that.
	Fry	So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
	Stephen Hawking	I call it a "Hawking Chamber".
	Fry	But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head.
	Al Gore	Well it's obvious what should have happened: That wang to the head should have killed you.
	Fry	Uh, what?
	Nichols	Let's finish the job.
	Al Gore	No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--
	Stephen Hawking	Hold him down.
	Deep Blue	Check.
	Fry	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
	Nichols	Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at.
	Gygax	Let's try something else. Maybe we should--
	Al Gore	Put the dice away before I take them away.
	Nichols	Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?
	Stephen Hawking	Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
	Bender	Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!
	Al Gore	Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed.
	Fry	Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
	Gygax	Here. Take my plus-one mace.
	Fry	OK, here I go.
	Al Gore	You fool! You foolish fool!
	Fry	Eh, what's the worst thing that can happen?
	Stephen Hawking	Great. The entire universe was destroyed.
	Fry	Destroyed? Then where are we now?
	Al Gore	I don't know. But I can darn well tell you where we're not: The universe.
	Nichols	Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.
	Gygax	Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
	Fry	Sure.
	Stephen Hawking	I guess.
	Deep Blue	Pawn to rook 8.
	Al Gore	I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
	Prof. Farnsworth	That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of. [He pushes the What-If machine into a bin.] Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success.
	Fry	Good work.
	Leela	Congratulations!
	Amy	Right on, Professor!
	Prof. Farnsworth	So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer. [He sighs.] A man can dream though. A man can dream.
