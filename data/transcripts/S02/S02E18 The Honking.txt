	Doctorbot	Notify his survivors.
	Bender	[singing] B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! [He walks into the room. Leela and Amy read magazines and Fry looks at a copy of Playbot. Bender dances.] B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ER--
	Hermes	Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue. Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade and, Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet.
	Leela	You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
	Hermes	And for Bender-- Uh-oh! A black-bordered envelope.
	Amy	Oh, no! Someone you know must've died.
	Bender	I hope it was one of my enemies; those guys suck! [He opens the envelope and gasps.] Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir.
	Fry	Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?
	Bender	Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will. [He screws up the letter and throws it behind him.] Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated! [He walks through the door then comes back.] C'mon, it'll be fun!
	Bender	Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle?
	Robot #1	Some say unholy things happen up there.
	Robot #2	For example: All of us say that.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
	Robot #2	Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not! With all your modern science are you any closer to understanding the mystery of how a robot walks or talks?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, you idiot. [He opens the robot's chest cabinet.] The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case.
	Robot #2	I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe.
	Robot #2	I will go this far and no further.
	Preacherbot	I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust to rust.
	Execu-Tor	[reading] To my loyal butler, You There, for his decades of service, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal instalments of one-twentieth of a pittance each. [You There bursts into tears.] To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million fortune.
	Tandy	[whispering] Is that a lot?
	Execu-Tor	[reading] And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle.
	Bender	Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
	Execu-Tor	[reading] On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
	Bender	Oh, man, there's always a catch!
	Bender	Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be--
	Leela	What is it?
	Bender	That painting, the eyes are watching me!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hmm. [He traces his glass backwards and forwards in front of the picture. The eyes follow the glass.] It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
	Bender	So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although-- [The MS Windows intro music plays, as if from nowhere. Someone laughs.] What's that?
	Zoidberg	I don't know, but it's infectious!
	Bender	No doubt about it, this place is haunted.
	Hermes	Don't be silly, mon. The last ghost died over 200 years ago.
	Bender	The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
	Leela	[reading] 0101100101. [talking] What does it mean?
	Bender	It's just gibberish. [He turns and gasps as he sees the numbers reflected in a mirror à la The Shining.] [reading] 1010011010?
	Bender	Uncle Vladimir!
	Vladimir-Ghost	Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!
	Bender	That's what they said about being alive.
	Robot Ghosts	[chanting] Join us! Join us! Join us, Bender!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly-shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms.
	Hermes	Of course! It was so obvious!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of.
	Bender	[screaming] Nooo!
	Fry	Bender, wake up! [Bender mumbles as he starts to come around.] He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?
	Leela	Bender, what happened?
	Bender	Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!
	Fry	Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount.
	Amy	Maybe he has. Look at these tracks.
	Leela	I think Bender may be telling the truth.
	Zoidberg	Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!
	Bender	Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over.
	Zoidberg	Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true.
	Leela	Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York. [She drops a newspaper onto the table. The headline "Hit And Run" dominates the front page.] There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
	Bender	Robot porno theatre? I was in that ... general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors must've followed me back here.
	Hermes	Bender, mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby.
	Bender	Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this: [crying] I scared!
	Vandal #1	I don't know which I like more: Smashing cars or smashing faces.
	Vandal #2	Well, lucky you don't gotta decide tonight. Now come on, we got church tomorrow. [The grey car quietly follows them. It rolls over a manhole cover and quickly parks.] Did you hear something?
	Vandal #1	Ah, it was probably just a golden marmoset.
	Vandal #2	That don't sound like no golden marmoset I ever heard.
	Vandal #1	Made it!
	Vandal #2	So anyway, what're you wearing tomorrow?
	Bender	Where--? What the--? [He tastes it.] Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
	Sal	Gets outta here, yous lousy bum!
	Bender	Please, I'm scared.
	Sal	We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!
	Bender	I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up I found these in my chest cabinet.
	Fry	Aw, relax, buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.
	Bender	No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh, Lord! I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown.
	Fry	Jeez, Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!
	Bender	You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense.
	Bender	Damn the expense!
	Gypsy	My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting horror!
	Bender	Phew!
	Gypsy	For, you see, you are a were-car.
	Bender	A were-car?
	Gypsy	The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to you through its demonic headlights.
	Leela	That's crazy!
	Gypsy	Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car.
	Bender	I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
	Gypsy	Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
	Bender	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
	Gypsy	Follow me.
	Gypsy	According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car.
	Bender	I'm with you.
	Gypsy	In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse.
	Bender	And otherwise I can never die?
	Gypsy	Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
	Bender	No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
	Gypsy	Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome until, one dark night, you are doomed to kill your dearest friend.
	Fry	I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
	Gypsy	[pointing] Now go! Go! [She presses against the glass and topples forwards.] Uh, could one of you just-- Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here.
	Leela	There. No rampaging for you tonight.
	Bender	Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
	Leela	Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.
	Fry	It'll be a rich, full day.
	Leela	Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them.
	Fry	[shouting] Bender, no!
	Leela	[shouting] Fry, stay back!
	Fry	[shouting] You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
	Fry	I can't believe this! Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me.
	Leela	Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
	Fry	Stop rubbing it in!
	Bender	Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?
	Fry	Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?
	Bender	I tried to run you over?
	Leela	It was very sweet of you, Bender.
	Bender	Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.
	Fry	Words. Nothing but sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter, orange wax in my ears.
	Leela	Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car.
	Fry	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
	Leela	Cursed, got it.
	Bender	Whatever.
	Leela	The tracks lead here.
	Fry	Thanks, eagle eye.
	Leela	Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful: Many robots are stupid and violent.
	Bender	[sarcastic] I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till--
	Yokelbot	Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers.
	Leela	We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!
	Yokelbot	Stop! What are ye doing?
	Bender	We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.
	Yokelbot	Ye think me be he?
	Bender	Sí.
	Yokelbot	Nee. I mean, "no". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching trip to the Arctic...
	Yokelbot	[voice-over] I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives called it "The Abominable Snowmobile".
	Inuitbot	Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school.
	Fry	I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
	Inuitbot	Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor.
	Inuitbot	[voice-over] You know him as Calculon.
	Calculon	[melodramatically] Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse.
	Bender	Let's kick him some more.
	Calculon	No, wait, let me explain. [melodramatically] It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago.
	Bender	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!
	Calculon	Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny!
	Fry	Look, are you the original were-car or not?
	Calculon	No, but you are nearing the end of your search. For, you see, I was attacked by the original were-car.
	Bender	Give us a name, MacButt!
	Calculon	The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm...
	Calculon	[voice-over] ...working in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project Satan ... [He puts a door onto the side of a red car.] ... a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield wipers from that car that played Knight Rider.
	Fry	Knight Rider wasn't evil.
	Calculon	His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway...
	Calculon	[melodramatically; voice-over] Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover they had made a horrible mistake. [A man turns the key in the ignition.] For, you see, it was pure evil.
	Leela	So what happened to Project Satan?
	Calculon	[voice-over] It's either in Paris, or much more likely...
	Calculon	[voice-over] ...still in the abandoned automotive lab.
	Leela	You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
	Bender	[whispering] Psst, there it is.
	Leela	It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan? [It growls feebly.] Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
	Project Satan	You do?
	Leela	Would you like us to ... put you out of your misery?
	Project Satan	Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard.
	Bender	Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.
	Leela	Oh, no! It's midnight.
	Bender	Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!
	Leela	Fry, distract him.
	Fry	[leaping around] Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian! 20 points!
	Leela	Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!
	Project Satan	That's right! Thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor, the most evil propulsion system ever conceived! [Bender completes his transformation and Project Satan pulls up beside him.] Take whichever one you want.
	Bender	Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!
	Fry	[gasping] Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy! [Bender rams Fry's legs twice. Fry tumbles onto Bender's roof, through the sunroof and inside Bender. The seatbelt comes around him.] [talking] Oh, thanks, Bender. [The seatbelt chokes him.] [choking] Too tight! Too tight!
	Leela	Whoa!
	Bender	Uh-oh.
	Leela	Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?
	Bender	[crying] I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
	Fry	Bender, I'm alive! [He climbs out.] You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters. [He opens a beer.] Here's to you.
	Bender	Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!
	Fry	I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!
