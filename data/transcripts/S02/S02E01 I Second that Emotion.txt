	Announcer	[voice-over] Futurama is brought to you by ... [The oval zooms back into a corner and is replaced by a monster that has eyes on stalks and large teeth.] ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!
	Leela	Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
	Fry	Is it me?
	Bender	[shouting] Ow, my head! My precious head! [Leela quickly turns the can opener off and Bender edges away from it.] [talking] Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!
	Fry	You alright, Bender?
	Bender	Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal.
	Leela	Don't yell at Nibbler like that. [She picks him up.] You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up.
	Bender	[turning away] No.
	Leela	I said pet him.
	Bender	I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands! [Nibbler leaps out of Leela's hands and bites Bender's shiny metal ass.] Ow! My ass! Get off!
	Leela	Are you alright?
	Bender	Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
	Leela	Not you. [She picks up Nibbler and looks in his mouth.] Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.
	Bender	Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it.
	Zoidberg	[reluctant] Alright, I'm coming.
	Jeffery	Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper gets the suppository. [The woman leaves.] Next.
	Jeffery	It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious.
	Bender	What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?
	Jeffery	No-- What? Huh?
	Bender	Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
	Leela	No!
	Bender	You about done?
	Leela	Next time I'm keeping it.
	Jeffery	OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room. [He walks through a door and doesn't close it. Fry, Leela and Bender step back in horror when they hear an animal growling. Jeffery struggles with the growling creature and glass breaks. He flails his legs around and runs back into the examination room. The door closes. His shirt is ripped and blooded and he has a bruised eye.] The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of my teeth out. [He chuckles.] Now then.
	Fry	Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?
	Jeffery	Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age.
	Fry	Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings.
	Jeffery	He's five.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Happy birthday, young Nibbler.
	Leela	Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!
	Bender	[sarcastic] I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
	Fry	Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
	Bender	Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. [He closes his eyes and uses his cheating unit to pinpoint the exact place the tail should go. He pins it on, opens his eyes and cheers.] And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?
	Amy	Hey, look at Nibbler!
	Hermes	Aww, he's holding a spoon.
	Zoidberg	He's so talented!
	Bender	You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime. [He takes off his head, whistles Sweet Georgia Brown and spins his head like a Globetrotter then reattaches it.] Ta-da!
	Hermes	Now he's wearing a hat!
	Leela	Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!
	All	[singing] What day is today?It's Nibbler's birthday,What a day for a birthday,Let's all have some cake.
	Fry	[singing] And you smell like one too!
	Bender	Hey, what about this?
	Leela	Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.
	Bender	Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.
	Leela	Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.
	Bender	So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.
	Bender	That'll take care of those annoying rats. [He puts it back in the cupboard.] Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me.
	Bender	There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public. [He turns around and washes his hands. While his back is turned Nibbler hops around the worktops and starts sniffing the cake. Bender turns around and sees.] No! Get away from there! [Nibbler gobbles up the cake and Bender screams. Nibbler burps.] That's it.
	Bender	Happy birthday!
	Leela	Bender, what's going-- [She gasps when she sees Nibbler disappear.] [crying] No!
	Bender	Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
	Amy	Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
	Bender	Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?
	Leela	[crying] Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
	Bender	Only one way to find out.
	Leela	[crying] You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
	Bender	Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
	Leela	You do?
	Bender	Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady.
	Prof. Farnsworth	And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go: The toilet.
	Leela	[crying] I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
	Calculon	[on TV] Give it to me straight, doctor, don't sugarcoat it.
	Doctorbot	[on TV] Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fianc√©e crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer.
	Bender	Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!
	Amy	It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
	Leela	I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged.
	Fry	Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
	Linda	[on TV] The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000.
	Bender	Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I need to tinker in it.
	Bender	Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip.
	Fry	And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes. If by "allow" you mean "force".
	Bender	Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow...
	Prof. Farnsworth	[hammering] Oh, dear. Oh, my. I got it. Once more.
	Bender	Ow! Professor!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[hammering] Steady now.
	Bender	Ow!
	Prof. Farnsworth	There we go. [He takes Bender's head out of the vice and rejoins it to his body.] Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
	Bender	My God! I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
	Zoidberg	That's me, baby!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hmm.
	Bender	Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her.
	Amy	Uh ... that's me.
	Fry	[whispering] Thanks for covering.
	Bender	This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
	Amy	Bingo!
	Hermes	That's Leela!
	Leela	Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain.
	Bender	Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
	Leela	I'm not mopey. You shut up!
	Bender	Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!
	Leela	Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already.
	Amy	Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy.
	Leela	A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
	Fry	What's your problem?
	Bender	[crying] I miss Nibbler.
	Fry	You do?
	Bender	Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. [He picks up a bottle of Olde Fortran.] Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?
	Bender	Uh-oh, jealousy. [He stands up and points at Fry.] [shouting] You think you're so hot!
	Fry	What?
	Bender	The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
	Fry	[crying] They're just responding to my personality.
	Amy	Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna be alright here by yourself?
	Leela	[theatrical happiness] Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
	Bender	[crying] I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream. [He walks off.] [crying] A bucket of--
	Fry	[shouting] The spoon's in the foot powder.
	Bender	I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.
	Fry	Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things, they stay alive in the sewers.
	Bender	Really?
	Fry	Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
	Bender	Hmm, sewers. [He scratches his chin.] Thinking, thinking, thinking.
	Bender	Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you. [He flushes the toilet but doesn't go anywhere.] Damn, it's too small. [He climbs out of it.] What did those human design this for anyway? [He disconnects his left arm, drops it down the toilet and flushes it away.] Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! [He spins his head off and flushes it.] See you on the other side!
	Fry	Bender? Bender?
	Fry	Have you seen my sombrero?
	Leela	Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
	Fry	Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad.
	Leela	You're right. I feel terrible.
	Fry	Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!
	Leela	I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
	Amy	Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
	Zoidberg	They're hideous!
	Leela	There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive run-off and good old American faeces!
	Fry	God bless America.
	Fry	Phew! Uh, ladies first.
	Fry	Oh, and the aftertaste!
	Leela	What is it?
	Fry	I burned my finger.
	Leela	OK, check the guidebook.
	Fry	Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met.
	Leela	Wait, what's that?
	Bender	I never should have thrown out the manual.
	Leela	Bender, you didn't have to come down here.
	Bender	I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
	Leela	[crying] He was so cute.
	Bender	[crying] He was so sweet.
	Fry	Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous. [He points the torch at something in the water.] Or maybe it's whatever that is.
	Leela	[shouting] Nibbler?
	Bender	[shouting] Nibbler?
	Leela	It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?
	Fry	Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe. [He points his torch at an extremely thin pipe. Bender and Leela glare at him.] Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile.
	Leela	[simultaneous] Idiot.
	Bender	[simultaneous] Idiot.
	Fry	OK, OK, never mind. I'll just ask those people for directions.
	Leela	[shouting] Mutants!
	Leela	Mutants! They're real!
	Fry	I'll take care of this! [He sets the end of the guidebook alight and points it at the mutants.] Back! Back!
	Vyolet	Thanks, handsome.
	Dwayne	Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless.
	Raoul	I have three arms.
	Dwayne	I said "harmless" not "armless".
	Vyolet	Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.
	Fry	Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants.
	Dwayne	Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants.
	Vyolet	Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?
	Raoul	Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world.
	Bender	You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?
	Dwayne	Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you.
	Leela	No, we're on the top.
	Fry	Daylight and everything.
	Vyolet	It must be wonderful.
	Bender	Eh.
	Leela	Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet.
	Raoul	Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me. [He opens an umbrella and Fry, Leela and Bender follow him, covering themselves.] All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over there is our aquarium. [He points at a fish tank with eight fish and a yellow bird floating dead on the top.] This is our library.
	Bender	Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
	Raoul	And over here is our church.
	Fry	Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
	Vyolet	Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter thing.
	Leela	[shouting] Nibbler?
	Bender	[shouting] Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.
	Fry	So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?
	Vyolet	No. That's just an urban legend.
	Bender	[pointing] Then what are those?
	Vyolet	Crocodiles.
	Raoul	We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them down into the sub-sewer.
	Dwayne	Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there.
	Vyolet	Please, that's just a sub-urban legend.
	Dwayne	Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ... [He snatches Fry's torch and shines it under his chin, emphasising his hideous-ness.] ... El Chupanibre.
	Leela	El Chupanibre? What's that?
	Dwayne	Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre.(singing) He creeps and crawls in the midnight hush,Silent as a low-flow toilet flush,Watch your step,'Cause sooner or later,He'll eat you whole,And half your alligator.
	Vyolet	Crocodile.
	Dwayne	Whatever.
	Leela	Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
	Bender	Hey, yeah!
	Raoul	You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies.
	Leela	You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
	Dwayne	Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice.
	Raoul	Yes. An unspoiled virgin.
	Leela	[raising her hand] I volunteer.
	Vyolet	Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage.
	Bender	Oh, I made myself feel bad.
	Raoul	She'll have to do. Chain her to the post! [Dwayne padlocks the chains around Leela. She stands under a shaft of light and faces a long, wide sewer pipe.] And rip her shirt a little. [Dwayne tears it a little and walks away.] Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, "virgin", he will be snared by this rope trap.
	Dwayne	[quietly] Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall.
	Leela	Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
	Dwayne	The tide is coming in.
	Vyolet	Quiet! The beast approaches.
	Bender	Nibbler! Aw, come here, precious! [He picks up Nibbler.] Look, everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
	Dwayne	That's not El Chupanibre.
	Bender	Say what?
	Dwayne	That's El Chupanibre.
	Fry	I'll take care of this.
	Leela	Bender, do something.
	Bender	I'm too scared.
	Fry	Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!
	Leela	I can't. I love every living creature.
	Fry	Even me?
	Leela	As a friend.
	Fry	Damn.
	Bender	Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you.
	Leela	Well, I could use a new tank top.
	Bender	Bigger! Bigger!
	Leela	A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
	Bender	Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit.
	Leela	Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
	Bender	Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
	Fry	Bender's gonna be killed!
	Leela	You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
	Fry	[cheering] Yeah!
	Leela	You did it!
	Raoul	Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
	Bender	No, thanks!
	Dwayne	Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender.[He strums the guitar.](singing) He came from above with a--[A string snaps and he sighs.](talking) It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another guitar string.
	Prof. Farnsworth	That was a disgusting story.
	Leela	And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender.
	Bender	I love you too. [He turns to Farnsworth.] Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own.
	Fry	Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity.
	Bender	And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!
	Leela	You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him. [She stands up and heads for the door.] [shouting] So long, jerkwads!
	Prof. Farnsworth	[waving] So long!
