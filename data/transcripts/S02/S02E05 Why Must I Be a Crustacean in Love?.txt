	Singer	[voice-over; singing; on TV] Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel.
	Plumber-bot	[singing; on TV] And we can also help with an impacted bowel.
	Singer	[voice-over; singing; on TV] Robo-Rooter!
	Fry	Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian cream dog that's also self-microwaving!
	Bender	Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. [On the remote he presses a "beer" button. A hatch on the top of the TV opens up and an extending arm carrying a beer bottle extends across the room. It flicks the bottle-cap off and Bender opens his mouth. The arm tips the bottle up and the beer splashes on Bender's chest.] Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?
	Leela	Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.
	Fry	Sack?
	Amy	And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense.
	Leela	Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
	Zoidberg	The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday.
	Amy	Hey, who's up for a nice, hot steam?
	Zoidberg	We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
	Nautilus	What up, Dr. Z?
	Zoidberg	Yo, yo, yo! Whassup, whassup! Give up the rock!
	Fry	Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
	Leela	Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room.
	Fry	Ah, futuristic!
	Amy	Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering.
	Leela	Those poor 20th century women.
	Amy	[sexfully] Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?
	Man	You wish!
	Fry	Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!
	Leela	Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you.
	Zoidberg	Give me that. [He lifts the weights off Fry, knocks him off the bench and takes his place. Enter Amy and Bender.] More weight!
	Fry	Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?
	Zoidberg	Enough with the questions. More weight! [The four add more weights.] More! [Amy and Fry leap onto the weights.] More!
	Leela	Maybe you could do more reps with less weight.
	Bender	Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell. [He chuckles.] Get it? [He chuckles again.] He's coming out--
	Randy Munchnik	Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress. [Zoidberg appears in the middle of the pool. The women scream and he scuttles out of the water. A woman spontaneously gives birth and her baby cries.] Is there a doctor in the gym?
	Zoidberg	I'm a doctor!
	Leela	I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
	Zoidberg	I am normal. [sexfully] Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!
	Amy	Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me.
	Fry	Maybe he has a parasite.
	Hermes	Maybe he is a parasite!
	Bender	It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative.
	Zoidberg	Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now.
	Amy	I'll do it.
	Leela	[simultaneous] Stop!
	Fry	[simultaneous] No, Amy!
	Bender	Moron!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Mm-hm... [He puts it on his shoulder.] Oh-ho! [He puts it on his chest.] Aha! There's the problem.
	Zoidberg	Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly.
	Leela	Bleck!
	Prof. Farnsworth	It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people; a chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
	Fry	Eck!
	Prof. Farnsworth	There's only one thing we can do--
	Bender	I'll get the water boiling!
	Prof. Farnsworth	We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.
	Fry	Oh, baby, I'm there!
	Leela	Fry, do you even understand the word "invertebrate"?
	Fry	Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. [shouting] Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!
	Amy	Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
	Bender	[from inside] Moron!
	Decapodian Man #1	Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!
	Zoidberg	Excellent, excellent!
	Decapodian Man #1	See you there, Doctor--
	Fry	Is that how you say "Zoidberg"?
	Zoidberg	You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
	Bender	You're looking less nuts, crabby.
	Zoidberg	I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. [sexfully] If you catch my drift.
	Fry	[nudging Zoidberg] Who's the lucky lobsterina?
	Zoidberg	I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
	Leela	It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
	Zoidberg	Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.
	Fry	You and me both, brother!
	Zoidberg	Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over.
	Zoidberg	I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then. [A tiny crustacean crawls out of the rock pool. Zoidberg picks it up.] Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?
	Bender	Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!
	Zoidberg	No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. [angry] They don't!
	Fry	I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
	Zoidberg	Same place as your species: The beach.
	Zoidberg	How do I look?
	Bender	Like whale barf.
	Zoidberg	Then the illusion is complete.
	Fry	Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.
	Decapodian Man #2	Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!
	Zoidberg	Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. [He jumps onto the mound and his fin pops up again. Some women walk past.] Craw!
	Fry	Look how ridiculous they look.
	Bender	Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive.
	Zoidberg	Craw!
	Decapodian Woman #1	Keep your jelly away from my eggs!
	Zoidberg	Craw?
	Decapodian Woman #2	So not interested.
	Zoidberg	Craw!
	Decapodian Woman #3	Humph. I've heard that line before!
	Zoidberg	Cra-- Oh, what's the point?
	Leela	Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
	Bender	'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.
	Fry	Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
	Zoidberg	Edna? Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember, from high school? [Edna makes a questioning purr.] You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!
	Edna	Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became a rich doctor.
	Zoidberg	I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?
	Edna	Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star.
	Zoidberg	Or maybe a doctor?
	Edna	I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again.
	Zoidberg	[crying] No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached.
	Leela	At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
	Zoidberg	[crying] You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!
	Fry	Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love. [He takes Leela's hand.] Just look her in the eye, start crying and say [fake crying] "I've never been so happy."
	Leela	If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
	Zoidberg	Hmm, this "love" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it.
	Fry	OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?
	Zoidberg	Ask her to mate with me.
	Fry	No. Tell her she's special.
	Zoidberg	But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
	Fry	Well, tell her that. And then?
	Zoidberg	Then mating.
	Fry	No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them. [Zoidberg raises his hand.] Yes?
	Zoidberg	Is "desire to mate" a feeling?
	Fry	You're not even trying!
	Zoidberg	It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
	Fry	OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.
	Zoidberg	What? Now there's a bird involved?
	Fry	OK, go ahead.
	Edna	What the-- Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?
	Zoidberg	[shouting] I have no idea.
	Fry	[whispering] You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.
	Zoidberg	[shouting] I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. [whispering] Fry, that doesn't make sense.
	Edna	Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK.
	Fry	[whispering] Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin.
	Zoidberg	[shouting] You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
	Edna	Why, yes. Thanks for noticing.
	Fry	[whispering] Now ask her how her day was.
	Zoidberg	Why would I wanna know?
	Fry	[whispering] You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
	Zoidberg	[shouting] How was your day?
	Edna	Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...
	Zoidberg	Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up.
	Fry	[whispering] That's normal. Just nod your head and say "Uh-huh".
	Zoidberg	[nodding] Uh-huh, uh-huh.
	Edna	...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental. [She sniffs.] You even stink more.
	Zoidberg	Do I ask her to mate now?
	Fry	[whispering] Third date!
	Bender	So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
	Zoidberg	[reading] I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
	Fry	[whispering] Turn it over.
	Zoidberg	Oh, Edna! [reading] Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest.
	Bender	Oy.
	Fry	[wiping a tear] That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
	Edna	Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps.
	Leela	Uh, me too.
	Zoidberg	I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?
	Fry	Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
	Leela	Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?
	Edna	Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?
	Leela	Yeah ... what? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey.
	Edna	Hmm.
	Edna	[from inside] Come in.
	Edna	[sexfully] Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?
	Fry	No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
	Edna	Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything. [She comes closer.] I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!
	Fry	Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!
	Edna	Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!
	Zoidberg	Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I-- [He sees Fry and screams. Fry manages to break away from Edna's grip and gasps for air.] [angry] Fry!
	Fry	Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.
	Zoidberg	[angry] Her caviar is on your neck!
	Fry	But--
	Edna	Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow.
	Fry	What?
	Zoidberg	[angry] Fry! [His fin reappears and knocks his hat off.] I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
	Fry	English, please?
	Zoidberg	A fight to the death.
	Edna	And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!
	Decapodian Emperor	The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna.
	Fry	But I don't want her!
	Decapodian Emperor	Once invoked, the sacred tradition of Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It is a recent tradition, only 18 years old, but it is a tradition none the less.
	Zoidberg	Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you.
	Leela	Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational.
	Zoidberg	[shouting] Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
	Leela	Aww.
	Fry	Leela!
	Leela	Right, right. [She turns to the Emperor.] You have to stop this madness.
	Decapodian Emperor	Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die.
	Bender	Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. [shouting] Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!
	Zoidberg	Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me. Disembowelling in your species: Fatal or non-fatal?
	Fry	Fatal.
	Zoidberg	Large bet on myself in round one!
	Decapodian Emperor	Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?
	Edna	I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--
	Fry	[shouting] Shut up!
	Edna	I love you, Fry!
	Decapodian Emperor	Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon. [Fry chooses a pair of giant nutcrackers from a case.] And you, doctor?
	Zoidberg	I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!
	Fry	Shh! Nobody correct him!
	Bender	Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.
	Fry	But it's a fight to the death!
	Bender	Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!
	Decapodian Emperor	Please rise for the national anthem.
	Fry	Uh-oh.
	Decapodian Emperor	[shouting] Let Claw-Plach begin!
	Fry	Hey!
	Bender	Ow!
	Leela	[shouting] Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!
	Fry	Aha! [He hits Zoidberg's hands with the nutcrackers and Zoidberg flies over his head and lands on his feet.] Oops!
	Edna	[screaming] Nooo! I can't stand to look.
	Zoidberg	Huh?
	Bender	Psst, Fry. Take a dive.
	Crowd	[chanting] Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! [Fry looks around at the crowd.] Claw-Plach! [He takes the nutcrackers from around Zoidberg's neck and throws them aside.] Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!
	Fry	My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why? [He raises his arm.] One reason. [Zoidberg cuts his arm off with one clean click of the claws. Fry looks at his lifeless arm on the ground and pulls his shirt up around his wound.] You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
	Leela	Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
	Zoidberg	Edna? Honey?
	Zoidberg	Edna?
	Leela	Ew!
	Bender	Oh, my God!
	Zoidberg	The frenzy! [His fin disappears back into his head.] Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it.
	Fry	Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.
	Fry	Ow, ow! Ah!
	Zoidberg	The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
	Fry	[holding up his arm] I'll lend you this.
	Leela	Fry!
	Fry	Hey, hey.
	Bender	Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
	Zoidberg	They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies.
	Fry	You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
	Zoidberg	Yes.
	Fry	Tough call.
	Zoidberg	Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry, especially after I made a complete eel out of myself.
	Fry	No biggie.
	Zoidberg	Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, passion for disembowelling. I owe it all to you. [He finishes reattaching the arm.] There! I pronounce the operation a success.
	Leela	Hooray!
	Bender	Yeah!
	Fry	[laughing] Yeah!
	Zoidberg	I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it.
	Fry	I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?
	Zoidberg	For you, my friend, anything.
	Fry	[from ship] My legs!
	Zoidberg	[from ship] Alright, alright, third time's the charm.
