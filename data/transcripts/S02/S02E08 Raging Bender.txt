	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love. [The toaster bounds across the table, barking like a dog and licks Bender. He knocks it away and it hits the wall. Toast springs out of it.] And Hermes returns from his vacation today.
	Hermes	[monotonous] Good morning, people.
	Fry	Hey, Hermes!
	Zoidberg	Hello!
	Leela	Good to see you.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yo!
	Bender	My man!
	Amy	So how was the Spleef Nebula?
	Hermes	[monotonous] The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug Planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.
	Fry	Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
	Leela	[whispering] Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
	Amy	[whispering] Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.
	Hermes	[monotonous] On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug Planet.
	Zoidberg	What are we going to do there?
	Hermes	[monotonous] Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. [He nods and then leans in to the others.] [whispering] Let's ditch him and go to the movies!
	Fry	Hey, yeah!
	Zoidberg	I'm seeing a movie with friends!
	Fry	Cool! Let's see this one!
	Leela	Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg.
	Amy	Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
	Zoidberg	Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. [He points to the films poster that parodies Planet Of The Apes except with Decapodians and bipedal clams riding bareback on horses.] It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
	Bender	Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.
	Fry	Yeah, I wanna see that.
	Bender	Good point, Bender.
	Fry	I'll take a small Slurm.
	Refreshment-bot	For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small.
	Fry	Uh, OK. [The robot puts a tiny cup under the machine and it fills with a drip. Fry takes it and walks away. He trips and it spills onto his shirt.] Oh, man!
	Bender	Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Down in front!
	Announcer	[voice-over; on screen] Glagnar's Human Rinds presents: This Week In The Universe.
	Fry	[sarcastic] Ooh, this is real futuristic!
	Crow T. Robot	Shh! Don't talk during the movie.
	Announcer	[voice-over; on screen] This week in the universe: New New York mayor C. Randall Poopenmeyer opens a new tube line to alleviate rush hour traffic. [In the movie, Poopenmeyer cuts a ribbon across a tube and the picture switches to people packed into another tube. The picture switches again to an alien army show.] Dateline: Paramecium Homeworld. Newly-crowned Miss Universe Gladice Lennox entertains troops fighting to wipe out the human race. [The soldiers cheer.] Go get 'em, boys! [The scene changes to a wrestling ring.] And in the world of Ultimate Robot Fighting, the Masked Unit wins his championship bout against Gorgeous Gonks by technical melting.
	Bender	[shouting] Go, Masked Unit! [A tall robot and a wide Fembot sit in front of him. The robot blocks his view.] Uh, hey, buddy! Yo! [He whistles.] You mind taking your head off?
	Robot	I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie.
	Bender	Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
	Robot	Sir, she is as the factory made her.
	Bender	Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
	Fembot	[in movie] Whee!
	Calculon	[in movie] Well, that finishes this paperwork. [The phone rings and he picks it up.] Calculon Enterprises.
	Monique	[on screen; in movie] Calculon, a fight scene has broken out at the special effects warehouse. Come quickly before a fiery explosion chases someone down a hallway.
	Calculon	[in movie] I have no choice but to--
	Mr. Moviefone	[voice-over; in movie] If you want Calculon to race to the laser gun battle in his hover-Ferarri, press 1. If you want Calculon to double-check his paperwork, press 2. Enter now.
	Mr. Moviefone	You have pressed 2.
	Fry	No, I didn't!
	Mr. Moviefone	I'm almost positive you did.
	Calculon	[in movie] Add in the carryover from form 16A, then deduct line 2B...
	Robot	Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be inadvertently kicking my seat.
	Bender	[mocking] "Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be bleh, bleh..."
	Robot	Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?
	Bender	Sure thing, pal.
	Robot	Uh, sir?
	Bender	[fake shocked] Who threw that?
	Robot	That's it! Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs!
	Bender	Oh, I'm boned.
	Hattie	Let's all go to the lobby!
	Robot	I'm gonna open a pile whup-ass on you!
	Leela	Bender, do you know who that was?
	Man #1	Cripes! The Masked Unit! You knocked him out cold.
	Man #2	I'm impressed.
	Doubledeal	Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur of jerks like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've ever seen.
	Bender	You should see me at funerals.
	Doubledeal	Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
	Bender	Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
	Flabby	My hero!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
	Bender	I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!
	Amy	Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!
	Bender	It is?
	Prof. Farnsworth	There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner.
	Bender	Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely.
	Bender	Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
	Leela	No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
	Fry	Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
	Leela	This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood.
	Zoidberg	Oh, again with the orphanarium!
	Leela	When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot.
	Leela	[voice-over] My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
	Fnog	Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate Keith when he regains consciousness.
	Leela	But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed.
	Fnog	Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will of the warrior.
	Leela	What do you mean? Watch this!
	Bill	[crying] Ow!
	Fnog	No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best, the schoolmarm.
	Leela	That's it. I'll take you on right now.
	Fnog	Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is already over. The winner? Me! [He laughs.] Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!
	Leela	I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
	Bender	Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
	Leela	Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
	Bender	Still ... can't ... reach!
	Bender	Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
	Referee	Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico: Bender! [Bender holds up an "Applause" sign and the crowd cheers.] And in this corner, from and made of Parts Unknown: The Clearcutter!
	Fry	[shouting] Bender rules!
	Hermes	[monotonous] I got you an official Bender hat.
	Fry	Wow! Thanks, Hermes! [He raises it to his head.] I-- Hey! Cut that out!
	Bender	You can't hit what you can't see!
	Leela	Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back. [The Clearcutter drags him away from her, drills something and slams him back down again. There is now a hole in Bender's head.] Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there.
	Bender	Huh?
	Referee	And the winner is ... Bender!
	Doubledeal	Nice work out there, kid.
	Bender	Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!
	Clearcutter	Hi, boss. Yo, dude!
	Bender	Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?
	Doubledeal	What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged. [Bender gasps.] It's a secret, so keep it under your head, but the most popular robot always wins.
	Bender	You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
	Doubledeal	Bingo!
	Bender	Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
	Doubledeal	In fact, you're more than popular, you're pure lowest common denominator.
	Bender	Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
	Referee	Presenting Bender the Offender!
	Bender	I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
	Referee	Versus ... Billionairebot!
	Referee	Versus: The Foreigner!
	Foreigner	I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!
	Referee	Versus ... The Chain Smoker!
	Chain Smoker	I love smoking. And after I win the fight I'm heading straight to your favourite restaurant.
	Bender	You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.
	Leela	Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
	Bender	What do you mean, "we"?
	Leela	I said "us".
	Bender	Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!
	Fembot #1	What about us, Mr. The Offender?
	Bender	Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
	Bender	Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?
	Doubledeal	Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction.
	Bender	What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
	Doubledeal	Bender, your popularity is slipping.
	Foreigner	Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.
	Bender	Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!
	Doubledeal	Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match.
	Bender	But the crowd loves me.
	Doubledeal	Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona: The Gender Bender.
	Billionairebot	You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
	Bender	Oh, yeah? [He throws down the tutu.] Well what if I don't let the new guy win?
	Doubledeal	Then he'll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way: To death! [He presses an intercom button.] Melissa, send in the new kid.
	Destructor	I am Destructor!
	Bender	[squeaky] See you at the fight.
	Bender	So then I said, "See you at the fight." And that's the story.
	Fry	Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
	Bender	It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.
	Leela	No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?
	Prof. Farnsworth	What the hell are you talking about?
	Leela	I don't know. But I'm not helping.
	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!
	Bender	[girly; on TV] I'm a real toughie!
	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor!
	Destructor	[on TV] I will destroy you! [He hangs up then picks up again.] And stop calling me!
	Fnog	[on TV] I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious for he has the will of a warrior!
	Leela	Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!
	Bender	[determined] I'll put on my tutu!
	"Cosell"	Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured tank, whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime, versus Gender Bender, who wears a pink tutu. [Hermes, his Brain Slug, Fry and Leela are in Bender's corner.] This is Rich Little, imitating Howard Cosell, here at ringside with George Foreman. George, a word in edgewise?
	Foreman	This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed.
	Little	Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0; a bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers.
	Foreman	It's not-not a smart bet.
	Leela	According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!
	Bender	Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!
	Hermes	Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
	Bender	Sorry, buddy. Here you go!
	Hermes	[monotonous] Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
	Amy	Here, Professor, I got you a programme.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses. [He puts on some glasses with super-thick lenses and opens the programme. His lenses rip through it.] Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here.
	Referee	In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls. Weighing 525lbs: The Gender Bender!
	Zapp	Boo!
	Richard Nixon	[shouting] Get that hippie out of the ring!
	Referee	And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!
	Fnog	So, we meet again. Most amusing: Girl who acts like fighter training fighter who acts like girl.
	Leela	Keep laughing, Fnog! [And he does. He walks back to his corner.] Ready, Bender?
	Bender	I was born ready! Gimme the bell! [The bell dings.] Did you hear a noise? [Destructor punches him across the ring. Bender gets up and snaps his wand then hangs his tutu neatly on a coathanger inside his chest cabinet.] Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain. [He kicks Destructor's shin but to no effect.] Now boarding standby passengers--
	Foreman	This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason. [Next to him, a grill grills five steaks.] With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth.
	Bender	[weakly] Fry! Throw in the towel! [He doesn't.] For God's sakes, Fry!
	Hermes	[monotonous] That's exactly what I was thinking.
	Bender	[weakly] Mommy!
	Leela	OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog? [There is nothing but an antenna in Fnog's corner.] Hmm.
	Bender	Why won't anyone help me?
	Leela	So, once more we meet again.
	Fnog	Huh?
	Leela	You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!
	Fnog	Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!
	Leela	[ironic] Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!
	Bender	Huh? It's bendering time! [He throws some fake punches.] Take this. And this!
	Fnog	You were an excellent student. [Leela throws a punch but he grabs her wrist.] Too bad I was a lousy teacher!
	Bender	I think you misunderstood the concept of "bendering time"!
	Fnog	See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!
	Leela	Yes!
	Bender	Yes! [Destructor falls on him.] Oh!
	Referee	And the winner is Destructor!
	Little	I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster.
	Foreman	It sure was some fight. Interesting side note: As a head without a body, I envy the dead.
	Little	No argument here.
	Fry	Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
	Amy	Fry, where's your Brain Slug?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Poor little guy starved to death.
	Leela	I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.
	Bender	I'm in tremendous pain here.
	Doubledeal	Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond.
	Bender	Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
	Little	And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.
	Foreman	And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
	Little	That he did surely not.
	Foreman	What?
