	Fry	Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six. [His knight charges at the bishop and the bishop batters it to the ground with his crook. The horse pulls out a dagger, stabs the bishop and kicks him off the game board. Fry chuckles and reclines in his seat.] Check.
	Bender	Hmm. Get him, boys!
	Fry	[hoarse] Good move.
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, everyone. [Hermes walks in behind him carrying a package.] We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace.
	Bender	Nope. Watching cartoons.
	Fry	Sorry.
	Leela	What's the mission?
	Professor Farnsworth	It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
	Fry	DOOP? What's that?
	Professor Farnsworth	It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry.
	Fry	Uh...
	Hermes	Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
	Fry	[getting it] Oh!
	Professor Farnsworth	Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
	Leela	What are we delivering?
	Professor Farnsworth	Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.
	Leela	We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
	Professor Farnsworth	Alright, but don't run with them.
	Fry	Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!
	Glab	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards.
	Fry	So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?
	Thog	Big rats there. Me crush with club.
	Fry	That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
	Glab	I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet. [She turns to the grey man.] What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?
	Neutral President	I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
	Zapp	I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they stand but with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me. [Kif sighs. Fry, Leela and Bender walk past with the scissors and Zapp stops them.] Halt. [They gasp.] Why, Leela, I do believe we've met.
	Bender	[whispering] He means you guys did it.
	Leela	If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.
	Zapp	Then you're under arrest.
	Leela	What for?
	Zapp	How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?
	Leela	But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
	Zapp	The Yarn People of Nylar 4? [He points at the pink creatures made of yarn.] So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you.
	Leela	What?
	Zapp	It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. [Kif sighs.] Search them for paper, and bring me a rock.
	Kif	Why?
	Zapp	So beautiful, yet so neutral. [He grabs her arms and handcuffs them behind her back.] Drag them to the ship.
	Glab	And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan.
	Zapp	What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?
	Kif	Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now.
	Zapp	No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ship's laser.
	Kif	Sir, I don't think that's wise.
	Zapp	Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise attitude.
	Zapp	Whoopsie-daisy!
	Glab	Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?
	Zapp	Absolutely 99% not guilty.
	Glab	Then the prosecutor will call his first witness.
	Hyper-Chicken	Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken from a backwoods asteroid but if it please the court I reckon I'll call the entire jury.
	Glab	I'm going to allow this.
	Hyper-Chicken	Members of the jury ... [He pecks the floor.] ... did y'all happen to catch a gander at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters?
	Juror #1	[simultaneous] That's the guy, right there.
	Juror #2	[simultaneous] Oh, yeah, right there.
	Glurmo	[simultaneous] That one.
	Hyper-Chicken	And are y'all gonna vote to convict him?
	Neptunian	[simultaneous] You'd better believe it.
	Juror #1	[simultaneous] You bet.
	Glab	The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony.
	Hyper-Chicken	Your Honour, the prosecution rests.
	Glab	The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of his years of service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid I must dismiss all charges.
	Leela	Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify.
	Glab	I'm going to allow this.
	Hyper-Chicken	Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, were you or were you not wearing a hoop skirt?
	Leela	That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye.
	Zapp	I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
	Glab	I'm going to allow this.
	Zapp	We've met before have we not?
	Leela	[reluctantly] Yes.
	Zapp	And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you you are still under oath.
	Leela	[reluctantly] Yes.
	Zapp	Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with. [Leela points at him and Fry hoots.] And his name is?
	Leela	Zapp Brannigan.
	Zapp	The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case.
	Glab	Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations.
	Glurmo	Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant ... guilty.
	Glab	Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and dismissed from the DOOP.
	Zapp	I'd like to make one final statement. Kif, c'mere and hold up the flag. [Kif scurries past him and holds up the DOOP flag behind him.] And wave it a little, for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault.
	Kif	What?
	Glab	Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged.
	Zapp	One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion space station and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think.
	Kif	No, it doesn't.
	Zapp	Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians. [He walks off and Kif doesn't follow.] That's an order, soldier.
	Fry	Hey, Bender?
	Bender	Yeah?
	Leela	Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to.
	Fry	You don't have to get so mad, Leela.
	Bender	Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.
	Leela	Zapp?
	Zapp	Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me.
	Leela	I never loved you.
	Zapp	I mean physically.
	Leela	What do you want?
	Zapp	Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you sexually, or mop the floors.
	Leela	You don't know how to do any of those things.
	Zapp	Kif might.
	Professor Farnsworth	Leela, who are you talking to?
	Zapp	Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.
	Professor Farnsworth	Why, you're that disgraced starship captain. [He turns to Leela.] Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record. [He turns back to Zapp and Kif.] Come in.
	Professor Farnsworth	I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. [He leans over to Hermes.] [whispering] Which ones are new?
	Hermes	The green dude and the fat man.
	Professor Farnsworth	Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either.
	Bender	I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. [He turns to Hermes and shrugs.] Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy!
	Zapp	So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?
	Fry	She's really strict.
	Bender	And mean.
	Zapp	I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
	Fry	No, she just makes us do work and stuff.
	Zapp	Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy, let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed.
	Bender	Hey, this guy's alright!
	Zapp	Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man.
	Kif	I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain.
	Leela	Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.
	Kif	Wait, what?
	Leela	I said "very nice work".
	Kif	This is the happiest day of my life.
	Leela	OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.
	Bender	They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
	Leela	They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
	Fry	Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.
	Leela	I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
	Bender	Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.
	Fry	Yeah!
	Zapp	That's using the old noodle!
	Zapp	Come on, girdle. Hold!
	Bender	Uh-oh.
	Leela	What the hell happened?
	Bender	Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.
	Leela	I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
	Fry	Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.
	Bender	I'll start loading up the pillows.
	Leela	No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand.
	Zapp	Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: Does the company that made your bra make a girdle as well? I ask because a friend of mine...
	Leela	Just get to work.
	Bender	[mocking] I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh.
	Fry	I agree.
	Kif	The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--
	Leela	Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?
	Kif	Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um... OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?
	Fry	Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.
	Bender	This is all Leela's fault.
	Fry	Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now.
	Zapp	Y'know, boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things.
	Fry	Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.
	Zapp	Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants.
	Bender	Beer?
	Fry	Underpants?
	Kif	But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free! [He laughs.] Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!
	Fry	This is a mutiny.
	Bender	You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.
	Fry	All hail the new captain.
	Zapp	Leela, you might be a formidable do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post.
	Leela	On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?
	Zapp	Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.
	Fry	We don't have a brig.
	Zapp	Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".
	Leela	You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
	Bender	You got it, genius.
	Leela	But, didn't I do a good job?
	Fry	You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
	Leela	Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.
	Fry	Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.
	Bender	Don't worry, Leela. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh.
	Zapp	Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine.
	Kif	What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?
	Zapp	Take them to the laundry-brig. [Kif leaves. Zapp turns to Fry and Bender.] So, do I have your loyalty, men?
	Bender	[saluting] To the ends of the universe.
	Fry	Ten hundred percent!
	Zapp	That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.
	Bender	Yes, sir, sir!
	Kif	Um, may I have a beer, sir?
	Zapp	No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet.
	Kif	Oh, jeez.
	Zapp	Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain.
	Kif	But, sir, that plan makes no sense.
	Zapp	Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialled in disgrace.
	Fry	Ooh, burn!
	Bender	Nailed you, buddy!
	Zapp	Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.
	Fry	This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ... [He screams and makes explosion noises.] ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...
	Zapp	Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him.
	Bender	[saluting] Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!
	Zapp	Fly the white flag of war.
	Zapp	[on screen] This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace.
	Neutral President's Aide	Should we trust him, Your Neutralness?
	Neutral President	All I know is my gut says maybe.
	Bender	What now, chief?
	Zapp	Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape.
	Fry	Good, good, then what?
	Zapp	Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board.
	Fry	Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
	Zapp	Of course. What do you think I meant by "loyalty"? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder.
	Fry	Leela, we want you to be captain again.
	Leela	Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? [They shake their heads and she puts the folded sheet on top of a pile.] He ran out of beer? [They shake their heads again.] So he's about to kill us?
	Fry	We want Leela to be captain again.
	Zapp	So it's mutiny, is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear.
	Kif	To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens to what I have to--
	Leela	Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. [The look ahead as they get closer to the planet.] We're gonna crash!
	Bender	Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo. [Fry smiles weakly.] And Fry.
	Leela	OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?
	Fry	Absolutely.
	Leela	Even if I make you work hard?
	Bender	As your God is my witness.
	Leela	Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
	Bender	Oh, man, that crap's heavy.
	Fry	And warm.
	Leela	Just do it.
	Neutral President's Aide	Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert.
	Neutral President	If I don't survive, tell my wife, "Hello".
	Leela	Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
	Bender	[on screen] Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.
	Fry	It's too low.
	Bender	Quick.
	Leela	You did it! You actually did it!
	Fry	And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
	Zapp	And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day.
	Glab	Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?
	Leela	Well, actually--
	Professor Farnsworth	[whispering] That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
	Leela	Your Honour, it's all true: My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it.
	Glab	In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, foo!
	Zapp	Come, Kif, we've got work to do.
	Kif	I-I'll call and tell you about it.
	Fry	Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever.
	Bender	Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?
	Leela	No.
	Fry	Please?
	Bender	Come on, Captain.
	Leela	Oh, alright.
	Professor Farnsworth	No time off.
	Fry	Aw, man.
	Leela	Let's mutiny!
