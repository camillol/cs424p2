	Hermes	Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived.
	Leela	Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.
	Hermes	Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies! [He opens the envelope.] Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!
	Professor Farnsworth	Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
	Bender	So we're in international waters?
	Professor Farnsworth	Indeed so.
	Bender	Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. [A speedboat pulls up next to the ship and a man hands Bender a package which he puts in his chest cabinet. The speedboat pulls away and Bender turns to Fry and Farnsworth who haven't noticed anything.] Hey, guess what you're accessories to?
	Leela	The sun, the sea air, good friends.
	Bender	Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?
	Hermes	Why not?
	Amy	Yeah.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yeah, cool.
	Bender	Everybody kick in five bucks. [Everyone except Zoidberg hands him $5.] There, wasn't that interesting?
	Leela	Bender!
	Fry	This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
	Bender	Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!
	Leela	I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon.
	Bender	Harpoon, my ass!
	Leela	OK.
	Hermes	Let's see now, which bait to use? [Zoidberg looks up.] Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?
	Zoidberg	Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic. [He eats a sardine.] These sardines for example are bland and tasteless. [He eats a few more.] And these dry, stringy night crawlers, though juicy ... [He eats a few.] ... very, very juicy--
	Hermes	I don't believe this! It's eating my bait! [He picks up his fishing rod and hits Zoidberg with it.] Beat it, you mooching crawdad!
	Bender	Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.
	Fry	[whispering] Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.
	Bender	Fine. I'll head over to the other side. [He leans over the side of the ship.] [shouting] Good luck fishing on this side!
	Fry	I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
	Bender	Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
	Fry	A shrimp? [Bender's laser guide appears between Fry's eyes.] I find it a bit hard to believe that--
	Leela	Aha! [She throws the harpoon and starts pulling it in.] Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!
	Amy	Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?
	Bender	Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
	Fry	Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. [He laughs and bends over. Bender hits him with his fishing rod again.] Ow! My small intestine!
	Leela	Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot.
	Professor Farnsworth	You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone. [He pulls out a spray can.] The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind. [He shakes the can and tries to spray it on his line but he is holding it the wrong way so it sprays back in his face.] Uh-oh!
	Zoidberg	[sexfully] I'm so into you!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, my!
	Fry	[shouting] Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!
	Bender	Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! [He throws his fishing rod in the bin.] If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish. [He takes Amy's parasol and bends it to make a giant fish hook.] There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending.
	Professor Farnsworth	Bender, be careful. That's the ships diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.
	Bender	Then why do I have to be careful?
	Professor Farnsworth	It belonged to my grandmother.
	Hermes	My Manwich!
	Leela	Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive! [She pulls out another boot with Zoidberg on the end of it and groans.] Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?
	Zoidberg	I wasn't wearing it. [ashamed] I was eating it.
	Leela	Come on, let's go home.
	Amy	Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
	Bender	I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella. [Amy growls.] What? I put sunblock on you.
	Amy	Well it didn't work!
	Leela	Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.
	Bender	Hey, I'm snagged.
	Professor Farnsworth	It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something! [Bender struggles to pull in the line. A huge shadow looms towards the ship from the water.] Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!
	Amy	It's coming up!
	Hermes	Oh, that's big!
	Professor Farnsworth	A colossal-mouth bass!
	Fry	It's diving!
	Leela	It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
	Zoidberg	Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament! [He snips at the tether with his claw but it doesn't break.] Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?
	Hermes	[from ship] My Speedos!
	Leela	Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!
	Professor Farnsworth	Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure.
	Fry	How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
	Professor Farnsworth	Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one.
	Bender	What's that? Is someone bending girders?
	Leela	We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
	Fry	How do we do that?
	Professor Farnsworth	That should do it.
	Amy	We're all gonna die!
	Fry	Wait, I'll be back in a minute.
	Leela	You did it, Fry!
	Fry	Did what?
	Bender	People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away.
	Leela	There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater.
	Bender	[restrained] Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
	Hermes	The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this. [He hold up the "Code of Conduct for Cannibalism" book.] Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg-- I mean lobster Newburg-- I mean Doctor Zoidberg.
	Leela	OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food.
	Fry	I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
	Hermes	Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugar cane truck.
	Professor Farnsworth	Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.
	Fry	I can't swallow that.
	Professor Farnsworth	Well then good news! It's a suppository.
	Zoidberg	How are you doing there, Fry? [Fry blubbers.] Glad to hear it. [He picks up another fish.] Aha!
	Bender	Aw, yeah!
	Zoidberg	Yum, yum, yum! [He eats it, not realising it is the top of a large pilot fish.] Uh-oh! [The fish chases him and Zoidberg woops and hides in a shell. The fish passes him and he scuttles back to Fry and Bender with the shell on his back.] Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!
	Zoidberg	Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous.
	Bender	Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog. [He opens the bottle and tries to drink what is in it but the liquid just drips out and trails away from him in the ocean current.] Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!
	Zoidberg	Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?
	Bender	Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.
	Zoidberg	What is it, Fry?
	Fry	[blubbering] I think I saw a mermaid.
	Bender	You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
	Zoidberg	Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire!
	Leela	Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.
	Fry	A mermaid!
	Amy	You think you saw a mermaid?
	Fry	No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions.
	Bender	Yeah, right!
	Leela	Sure she did.
	Hermes	OK, Fry!
	Professor Farnsworth	You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron.
	Fry	What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.
	Leela	I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
	Fry	Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.
	Leela	[whispering] Ocean madness.
	Professor Farnsworth	He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
	Fry	[muttering] Ocean madness. Yeah, right. It's always something, ain't it? [The mermaid knocks on the window and Fry gasps.] [talking] It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up! [Bender turns up the volume on himself and snores louder. The mermaid beckons Fry. He heads for the door then remembers something.] Oh! oxygen!
	Mermaid	Here you go, darlin'.
	Fry	Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!
	Mermaid	Oh, you speak fish?
	Fry	What?
	Mermaid	I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!
	Fry	I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?
	Umbriel	Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.
	Fry	Aw, yeah!
	Umbriel	Did it just get warmer?
	Fry	I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
	Umbriel	Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips.
	Fry	Oh, thanks. They're called pants.
	Umbriel	This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.
	Fry	No kidding.
	Umbriel	Did it just get colder? [Fry jabs some shrimps with a stick and toasts them over the vent.] Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?
	Fry	Sure. Sometimes it falls from the sky.
	Umbriel	Hm.
	Fry	And sometimes it doesn't.
	Umbriel	Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!
	Fry	You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.
	Umbriel	Lions? There are sealions on the land?
	Fry	Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
	Professor Farnsworth	I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mâché is dry.
	Leela	Where's Fry?
	Bender	I didn't kill him. Professor?
	Professor Farnsworth	No, I've been busy.
	Hermes	He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor, demented honky.
	Leela	It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep-down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!
	Professor Farnsworth	We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen.
	Bender	I got it covered. [He opens his chest cabinet and the crew take out some oxygen masks and put them on.] In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device.
	Professor Farnsworth	Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken your pressure pills, right?
	Amy	Yes! Stop asking!
	Zoidberg	I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
	Bender	[awestruck] Bend me!
	Amy	Dude! An ancient sunken city!
	Professor Farnsworth	Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true? [Leela rubs away the flora from the sign, revealing "City Of Atlanta". The staff gasp.] It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!
	Merman	Howdy, y'all!
	Colonel	Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel. [Bender hums Dueling Banjos.] Here, have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce.
	Professor Farnsworth	This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository.
	Colonel	Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!
	Bender	Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! [whispering] I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!
	Fry	Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.
	Colonel	Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees.
	Amy	So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?
	Fry	I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
	Umbriel	No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York.
	Fry	That's right, honey! Whatever you say.
	Umbriel	Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh, the airport.
	Leela	But tell us, how could a city with such a ... fabulous airport end up underwater?
	Colonel	Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folk-rock troubadour Donovan.
	Donovan	[on screen] Atlanta was a city, landlocked,Hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean,Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism,That they moved offshore, becoming an island,And an even bigger Delta hub,
	Donovan	[on screen] until the city overdevelopedAnd it started to sink.Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy,The Guy Who Invented Coca-Cola, the Magician,And the other so-called gods of our legends,Though gods they were--And also, Jane Fonda was there.
	Donovan	The others chose to remain behindOn their porches with their rifles,And one day evolve into mermaids,And sing and dance,And ring in the new.
	Mermaids	[on screen] Hail Atlanta!
	Leela	The magician?
	Bender	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?
	Umbriel	Normally, yes, but the caffeine really sped things up. [She points at a leak in the Coca-Cola factory.] That stuff's wonderful.
	Colonel	So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if Old Legs here ain't grown on me!
	Fry	Aw, shucks, Colonel.
	Hermes	Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry.
	Fry	Wait. I'm not going with you.
	Leela	But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here.
	Zoidberg	She's right, I mean, sure, they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.
	Professor Farnsworth	Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?
	Fry	Realise it? I don't even understand it!
	Professor Farnsworth	It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
	Fry	I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] I'm bored! Let's go!
	Zoidberg	You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?
	Fry	Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.
	Bender	[crying] Oh, Fry! [He bawls.] I'll miss you!
	Colonel	Y'all come back now, y'hear?
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] Let's go, damnit! Let's go!
	Zoidberg	Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well.
	Leela	Whatever.
	Amy	Later.
	Professor Farnsworth	Bye.
	Zoidberg	No! My home! It burned down! [Hermes and Bender walk out of the ship. Zoidberg cries.] [crying] How did this happen?
	Hermes	That's a very good question.
	Bender	So that's where I left my cigar.
	Hermes	That just raises further questions!
	Fry	You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life.
	Umbriel	Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me.
	Fry	Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
	Umbriel	What the hell is that?
	Fry	Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
	Umbriel	I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser.
	Fry	[gasping] Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?
	Umbriel	Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?
	Colonel	Well what about that rich, young dugong from Macon?
	Professor Farnsworth	There! The engine modifications are complete.
	Leela	Prepare for launch.
	Fry	Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque for $1000.
	Leela	It's you!
	Bender	Hey, buddy!
	Hermes	My Manwich!
	Leela	Fry, are you alright? What happened?
	Amy	What about Umbriel?
	Fry	Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.
	Amy	[whispering] Trouble in bed.
	Bender	Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Wait a-- This is no record! Gimme back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant orphans.
	Fry	Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!
	Zoidberg	Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
	Donovan	[over credits] Hail Atlanta!
