	Fry	Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace.
	Bender	Tough luck!
	Fry	Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?
	Bender	[pointing] Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.
	Fry	Do you think we should?
	Bender	[firmly] Yes, I do.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?
	Leela	[patting her pockets] I must've left them onboard.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Eh, wha? I mean, what?
	Leela	Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.
	Amy	Oh, no!
	Hermes	Sweet ghost of Babylon.
	Zoidberg	This isn't good for Zoidberg!
	Fry	Woo, yeah!
	Bender	Woo-hoo!
	Bender	Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!
	Fry	That's the best thing I ever saw!
	Italian #1	You stink!
	Italian #1	Alright, yeah!
	Italian #2	We like you a lot!
	Fry	That was great!
	Bender	And no one suspects a thing! [He laughs and gasps when he sees the rest of the staff standing angrily at the bottom of the steps.] Whoa! [A wall collapses.] And that's how we learned our lesson!
	Prof. Farnsworth	You've gone too far this time -- all three of you!
	Leela	What did I do?
	Prof. Farnsworth	You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?
	Fry	Yeah, Leela.
	Bender	We're all very disappointed in you.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted.
	Hermes	You're all fired.
	Zoidberg	[waving] Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you. [They round a corner and hear Zoidberg talking to the others through a hole in the wall.] Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.
	Amy	Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking, do you think we could go out?
	Prof. Farnsworth	So, Zoidberg, what's new?
	Hermes	Tell me, Zoidberg: Is it carapace or carapass?
	Zoidberg	Oh, you know!
	Fry	What are we supposed to do for money? [He opens his wallet.] All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache ... [He holds it up in a bag.] ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with.
	Bender	Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund? [Leela slaps his wrist.] Ow!
	Leela	We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!
	Fry	Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
	Leela	No, we can get jobs.
	Bender	But we just had jobs!
	Leela	Fortunately, I still have our old career chips.
	Fry	Our what?
	Leela	Career chips. [She holds one up.] You remember? They assign you the job you're best at. [Fry stares blankly.] I tried to give you one and you ran away. [No response.] It's how we met!
	Fry	And then what happened?
	Leela	Just give me your hand.
	Fry	Ow!
	Leela	Baby! [She clips herself.] Ow!
	Leela	I'd like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.
	Ipgee	Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays.
	Leela	Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir.
	Ipgee	Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip. [He takes something out of another drawer and scans Leela's hand. It beeps and he looks at his computer screen.] Calcutta, we have a problem.
	Leela	Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mi--
	Ipgee	Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?
	Fry	They're OK.
	Ipgee	Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary?
	Bender	Hey, let's see what it says about me.
	Ipgee	Welcome aboard, sir.
	Terry	Remember, when the tube opens, say ... [melodramatically] ... "Welcome to the world of tomorrow!"
	Fry	Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up. [The freezer pings and opens. A man walks out, clutching his head.] Bathroom's that way.
	Fry	So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me what brings you to the future.
	Man	Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical.
	Fry	Nope. Straight line. [His control panel pings.] Ah, the Probulator's done.
	Man	That wasn't so bad.
	Fry	Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet. [The machines start making noises and the man screams.] OK, it's about to start.
	Bender	Welcome to the future, human slave. [The man trembles and Bender laughs.] Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly! [He takes the cape and head off.] I'm a horrible robot! [The man backs into the freezer and Bender walks towards him, turning his head and outstretching his arms.] Kill all humans!
	Terry	Dear God! He's having a heart attack!
	Bender	Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.
	Terry	We have a cure for it now!
	Bender	Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.
	Fry	Nothing like a power nap.
	Old Man	Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!
	Bender	Stay beautiful, doll-face! [The door closes.] That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?
	Fry	I ordered a pizza.
	Leela	Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener. [Fry and Bender laugh.] Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95.
	Fry	Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free.
	Leela	It's only been 23 minutes.
	Fry	[checking his watch] Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.
	Chef	It's only been a-23 minutes, you dumb a-cannoli. You got a problem, we can take it outside.
	Fry	OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him.
	Leela	Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform.
	Chef	35, you stupid meatball.
	Bender	Who should be unfreeze next?
	Fry	No. [They pass Weird Al Yankovic.] No! [They move onto the next one.] Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!
	Bender	Alright!
	Fry	Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!
	Shore	Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it.
	Fry	Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!
	Shore	An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations demonstrating, incontrovertibly, that the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately tetrahedron, buddy!
	Fry	Oh. [He coughs.] So, how did you wind up getting frozen?
	Shore	Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re: cryogenics was peaked, and I resolved to freeze the weasel.
	Fry	The weasel?
	Shore	Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?
	Fry	I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
	Shore	Like what?
	Fry	I love this job.
	Bender	Me too.
	Fry	Showtime! [hoarse] I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
	Bender	Boo?
	Fry	Michelle!
	Bender	Oh, my God!
	Michelle	Fry? Is it really you?
	Fry	I don't know. Is it really you?
	Michelle	What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?
	Fry	Who wants to know?
	Michelle	Oh, Fry, it is you!
	Fry	I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?
	Michelle	Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married.
	Fry	I'm sorry.
	Michelle	[voice-over] His name was Charles. He attended a law school so prestigious the basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [The flashback changes to Michelle waving Charles off outside one of his classes. The basketball team runs by and Ruth Bader Ginsburg blows a whistle. Then it changes to Michelle being bitten by a pack of barking dogs.] I put him through law school by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs.
	Fry	Sorry.
	Michelle	[voice-over] But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties.
	Fry	Uh, sorry.
	Michelle	[voice-over] Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that could lessen my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately, a corn dog bone got lodged in the control panel of the Spizzler, and I had to ride it for eight hours.
	Fry	[voice-over] Sorry.
	Michelle	[voice-over] But it did give me a chance to think...
	Fry	I'm sorry.
	Michelle	And I remembered the last time I was truly happy; when I was with you.
	Fry	Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
	Michelle	No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to you -- no one did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents felt it was a waste of taxpayer money.
	Fry	That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?
	Michelle	Not really. Except for one person.
	Fry	Who was it?
	Michelle	Everything is so different.
	Fry	Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
	Michelle	Ew!
	Michelle	Eurgh.
	Fry	Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys.
	Sal	I'm on loan from the Louvre.
	Leela	Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.
	Bender	Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ... [He puts his gorilla mask on.] ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew.
	Prof. Farnsworth	So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?
	Amy	Great!
	Hermes	Organised!
	Zoidberg	For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces.
	Leela	Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
	Fry	Hey, guys.
	Leela	Oh, uh, hey, Fry!
	Bender	So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!
	Fry	I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle. [Everyone claps.] Michelle, this is Leela. [Michelle screams.] This is Bender. [Michelle screams.] The Professor. [Farnsworth waves. Michelle looks at Fry and he nods. She screams.] Hermes and Amy.
	Michelle	Nice to meet you.
	Fry	And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
	Hermes	Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?
	Fry	All what?
	Prof. Farnsworth	This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--
	Bender	A home invasion by a former roommate.
	Fry	But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.
	Zoidberg	There you go, dearies.
	Michelle	It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future.
	Amy	I'm from Mars.
	Michelle	[trembling] I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.
	Leela	[sitting down] Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
	Michelle	That's true. But I used to fit in really well.
	Zoidberg	Then good luck, sister.
	Michelle	Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of freaks.
	Fry	Yeah, they're great, huh?
	Michelle	I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream that doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job.
	Fry	Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed. [He picks up the implant gun.] Hold out your palm. [Michelle whimpers.] What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced.
	Michelle	This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. We'll go someplace where all we have is each other.
	Fry	Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there.
	Michelle	It's not a "there". It's a "then". [She turns a freezer dial to 1000 years.] The future.
	Fry	Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff.
	Michelle	I love you. Don't you love me?
	Fry	Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step.
	Michelle	Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters but our love.
	Fry	You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
	Fry	Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it.
	Fry	The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
	Michelle	It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us here.
	Fry	No, you brought us here.
	Michelle	Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come on, build us a shelter.
	Fry	Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live.
	Fry	There!
	Michelle	You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?
	Fry	It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.
	Michelle	Oh, look! Some little kids.
	Fry	They'll save us. [The kids point guns at them.] We're saved!
	Butch	I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing about it.
	Michelle	OK.
	Fry	Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?
	Butch	Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works.
	Fry	I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him.
	Michelle	You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief.
	Fry	What do I need, ulcers?
	Michelle	But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over me with her fancy coyote hide.
	Fry	Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.
	Butch	On what grounds do you challenge my authority?
	Fry	Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up.
	Kid #1	Yeah, I'll bet he could.
	Butch's Girlfriend	He's got arm hair.
	Butch	Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this: Death rolling!
	Fry	What's death rolling?
	Orowheat	It's like skateboarding.
	Ice-V	Except half the time, someone dies.
	Fry	Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.
	Butch	Last one holding the bandana's the new leader.
	Michelle	My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong.
	Fry	[sadly] Beth said that?
	Butch's Girlfriend	Achat, shtayim, shalosh!
	Butch	It's cool. Back off! [He looks at his bleeding knee.] [crying] My knee. I scraped it!
	Fry	Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at-- Aha! [He snatches the bandana and dances around.] I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
	Butch	Hand it over, you giant idiot.
	Butch's Girlfriend	Hey, Butch, your mom's here.
	Butch	Aw, man.
	Butch's Mom	Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew school.
	Orowheat	I don't wanna go.
	Butch's Girlfriend	Every Monday and Wednesday's the same thing.
	Fry	I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.
	Michelle	That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000.
	Fry	Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything.
	Michelle	Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole we are going to have a long, boring talk about our relationship!
	Fry	Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: [whispering] I'm leaving you.
	Fry	There must be people somewhere.
	Fry	Yes! Footprints! And hand prints? [The mist clears some more and he sees the foot and hand prints are signed by Clark Gable. Some more signatures appear including those of Florp, Dame Calista Flockhart, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Slurms MacKenzie, Calculon and James Mason.] But? What's happening?
	Leela	Fry, thank God we found you.
	Fry	Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
	Leela	It's not the year 4000.
	Bender	You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.
	Leela	But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch.
	Fry	So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
	Prof. Farnsworth	You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
	Fry	But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.
	Leela	Exactly, you're in L.A.
	Fry	But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
	Bender	That's L.A. for you.
	Fry	But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
	Bender	He just won't stop with the social commentary.
	Fry	And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it-- [A limo pulls up and the window comes down. Inside, Michelle and Pauly Shore drink champagne.] Michelle, baby!
	Michelle	It's not working out, Fry.
	Shore	[shouting] Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?
	Fry	That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you.
	Bender	'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, that's right. Get lost!
