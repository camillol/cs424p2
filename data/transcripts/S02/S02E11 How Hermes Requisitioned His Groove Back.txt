	Hermes	Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to Stampy Town. Population, five! [He stamps the form five times then puts it on top of a pile of other forms. He picks up the pile and staples it together.] And now for the finishing touch. [He puts the pile through a shredder and it comes out as mulch, which is recycled into blank sheets of paper. A robotic arm lifts the paper into the in-tray.] Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy. [A red tube comes down a message tube and lands in a tray.] Sweet gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy! [He takes a piece of paper out of the red tube.] [reading] Attention, Hermes Conrad: You are about to receive a letter from the Central Bureaucracy. [Another red tube appears and Hermes takes a piece of paper out of.] My God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!
	Leela	I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
	Bender	I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
	Fry	I'll play.
	Bender	I'm in!
	Zoidberg	Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available.
	Leela	We're playing poker. But I'm warning you, my friends are serious players.
	Zoidberg	Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking.
	Fry	Wow! You look happy. Is someone fired?
	Hermes	Better! The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I will finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is.
	Leela	Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip.
	Hermes	Sorry, I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way: A glass of warm milk and good night sleep.
	Fry	Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer-space potato man.
	Leela	Ah, that must be my old boss.
	Ipgee	Hello, Leela. You're fired.
	Leela	I know.
	Ipgee	I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this point.
	Terry	[dramatically] Let the games begin!
	Ipgee	So I told Leela, "Your request for a date is most flattering but I must decline." These office romances never work out. After all, that is how I met my horrible wife.
	Leela	But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
	Ipgee	And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives separate.
	Bender	Come on, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.
	Fry	What's with the specs, Bender?
	Bender	They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
	Fry	Hey!
	Zoidberg	I can't spell anything with these cards.
	Zoidberg	Finally, I have a good claw. See? [He turns his cards around.] Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery.
	Fry	It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak.
	Bender	Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades! [He taps his shades and they suddenly change to X-Ray specs. He looks at the cards around the table.] Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage. [He lays his cards out on the table.] Read 'em and leak salt water!
	Fry	Oh, man!
	Terry	That's my baby's milk money!
	Ipgee	Oh, I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?
	Bender	If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
	Ipgee	[suspicious] Let me see those glasses.
	Bender	Um ... uh...
	Ipgee	Oh, my various Gods! X-Ray specs!
	Bender	Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need 'em for reading stuff ... on the other side of stuff.
	Lou	Cheater!
	Ipgee	Get him!
	Terry	Break his neck!
	Zoidberg	No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
	Bender	[from inside] Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy with X-Ray glasses would you? [Beating sounds come from inside.] Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!
	Hermes	Great cow of Moscow!
	Bender	Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!
	Hermes	Oh! I'll never pass inspection now. They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick ... at carnival time. [Fry and Leela poke their heads around the door.] [crying] And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
	Fry	Aw, hey, c'mon, don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
	Hermes	It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
	Hermes	Who the hell are you?
	Morgan	Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19.
	Hermes	Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36.
	Morgan	Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
	Hermes	This way, please.
	Fry	[whispering] Jeez, Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this.
	Hermes	[whispering] Don't worry. I have a plan.
	Hermes	[shouting] I'm going to jump!
	Amy	[shouting] No!
	Zoidberg	[shouting] No!
	Bender	[shouting] Do a flip!
	Leela	[shouting] Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for.
	Bender	[whispering; to Leela] I get it, reverse psychology.
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] Please, old friend, don't jump. Use another method that won't damage your liver. Other people need it, you know.
	LaBarbara	[shouting] Husband! Nooo!
	Hermes	Outta my way, wife! I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form, so I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby body.
	Morgan	[shouting] Bureaucrat Conrad, if you complete your death transaction without filing a suicide and/or falling accident permit, you will be posthumously demoted.
	Hermes	Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
	Hermes	Sweet something of ... of someplace.
	Morgan	As your superior, I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation.
	Hermes	Oh! The ultimate penalty!
	Zoidberg	I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read.
	LaBarbara	Spa 5? Is it good?
	Zoidberg	Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they give me a bucket of krill for every patient I send.
	Morgan	Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away. I assign me, I accept. Welcome aboard.
	Zoidberg	Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat. Hurrah!
	Morgan	I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?
	Leela	Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
	Fry	[ashamed] I thought it would fit.
	Morgan	[to Bender] And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?
	Bender	Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
	Leela	I can explain--
	Morgan	You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of olives? I think not.
	Leela	[whispering] What is this, high school?
	Morgan	Locker check!
	Morgan	Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?
	Leela	What?
	Morgan	The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
	Bender	[ashamed] Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely.
	Morgan	I-- I've never seen anything like this. [She picks up the cap.] Why is there yoghurt in this cap?
	Fry	Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all.
	Morgan	You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone.
	Fry	Uh, wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm "Phry" with a P-H.
	Morgan	[taking off her glasses.] Admit it, Fry: You're a slob. [She kisses him.] A dirty, filthy slob. [She kisses him again.] Dirty boy! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!
	Fry	What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
	Morgan	I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you.
	Fry	[bashful] Oh, stop!
	Morgan	Now listen, you filthy pig. No one can know about us. If anyone asks, I'll deny it.
	Fry	Just like very other girl I've dated.
	Woman	And two and three and four and ... [She point a huge laser at them.] ... come on, work those arms!
	LaBarbara	[whispering] This is no spa, it's a forced-labour camp.
	Hermes	Curse that Dr. Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business-end of a shrimp fork.
	Australian Man	Give him one for me too, mate. I don't know why I go to him.
	Woman	I don't miss twice, campers!
	Morgan	And for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot.
	Leela	Co-pilot? Under who?
	Morgan	The autopilot.
	Leela	That drunk?
	Morgan	Mr. Bender, you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions.
	Professor Farnsworth	That's a full-time job.
	Morgan	And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine.
	Fry	Alright!
	Morgan	Mr. Bender, would you high-five him so we can continue this meeting? [Bender reluctantly does.] And on the rebound? [Bender kicks Fry in his left shin and Fry screams.] Meeting adjourned.
	Amy	I can't figure why she's so nice to you, Fry.
	Zoidberg	She's a hateful monster, this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you, she's risking my friendship with her.
	Leela	Bender, what happened to you?
	Bender	Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag. [Leela gestures him to shut up.] Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?
	Morgan	No. I'm in front of you.
	Fry	Morgan? It's 3am.
	Morgan	I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you. [She looks around the messy apartment.] My God! It's so ... repulsive. [She looks at something covered with a sheet and food.] So, uh, this is where you eat?
	Fry	Eat and sleep.
	Morgan	Oh, Fry!
	Fry	Uh, wait, Bender's my roommate. He could be back any second.
	Morgan	Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's ear wax.
	Bender	Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with-- [He gasps.] What the--? [He zooms in. Morgan is in bed with Fry. She holds the sheets up around her. Fry pulls the sheets up around him.] Oh, now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place: The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions. [Morgan runs out with the sheets wrapped around her.] It's all coming together now!
	Bender	I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson.
	Fry	[shouting] Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop.
	Bender	For I was blind but now I see!
	Bender	[from inside] The cat's out of the bag now!
	Morgan	Mr. Bender, about last night: That was just a ... a misunderstanding.
	Bender	Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ... [He points at Fry.] ... were having sex with you.
	Morgan	No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternise.
	Bender	That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say "You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it," and they'll say "Who, Bender? Who?" and I'll say "It was lovable ... [His voice begins to slow down.] ... old Bender."
	Fry	Hey, what did you do to him?
	Morgan	I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface.
	Bender	[mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
	Fry	But, but ... Bender need brain ... for ... smart making. [Morgan puts the disk in a red tube and sends it away.] What did you do now? Stop doing things!
	Morgan	I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do, Fry; He was a bad robot.
	Fry	No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.
	Morgan	Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.
	Fry	I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!
	Morgan	Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
	Leela	You and Morgan were having an affair?
	Fry	I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
	Bender	[mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
	Fry	Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
	Amy	Yeah!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, yes, we must, yes.
	Amy	Why?
	Leela	Well, those arguments aside, we're still going.
	Professor Farnsworth	You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
	Leela	Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, I've been there. Lots of times!
	Hermes	Look at that: The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally inefficient.
	Australian Man	[whispering] Quiet, mate. Pulling the empty carts is the closest thing we get to sleep.
	Hermes	But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to bring in heavy mining machinery.
	Man	Hey, I like the way you think.
	Australian Man	Oh, Lord!
	Man	You know, you oughta be a bureaucrat or something.
	Fry	Man, how long is this gonna take?
	Old Man	I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh, but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.
	Old Man	Oh, great! Someone had a baby.
	Leela	Come on. I have a better idea.
	Leela	Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.
	Bender	[mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
	Grade 53 Bureaucrat	Looks like we've got a new office cut-up!
	Grade 41 Bureaucrat	Look out! Look out! I'm gonna crash my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid you.
	Leela	While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?
	Grade 41 Bureaucrat	Oh, you want Central Filing.
	Leela	OK.
	Fry	OK.
	Amy	OK, thanks.
	Professor Farnsworth	Wonderful.
	Grade 41 Bureaucrat	[screaming] Nooo!
	Grade 20 Bureaucrat	Central Filing? Of course I know where that is. I'm a grade 20.
	Leela	Where is it?
	Grade 20 Bureaucrat	I can't tell you. What do I look like? A grade 16?
	Leela	We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room. [She takes something of her wrist machine and puts it in the tube.] Then we'll track it using my wrist LoJack-a-mater.
	Wrist Machine	Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
	Grade 11 Bureaucrat	Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping.
	Leela	This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?
	Fry	We'll never find that disk will we, Bender?
	Bender	[mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
	Fry	You're right. Nothing is over as long as there's one thin ray of hope.
	Morgan	Lost something? [She rides a slow-mobile towards them.] I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.
	Fry	Listen, Morgan, we're through. You're an evil, heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However, would you help us get Bender back for old time's sake?
	Morgan	I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile, and it would take some sort of giant, mechanical, atomic-powered sorting machine to find him.
	Hermes	You rang?
	Professor Farnsworth	Damnit, Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver.
	Hermes	No, I want to live. Organising that forced-labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy.
	LaBarbara	My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour is now done by a single Australian man.
	Leela	But how did you know we were here?
	Hermes	Dr. Zoidberg brought us.
	Zoidberg	It was me! I'm the hero!
	Number 1.0	Request for explanation of incident meeting?
	Morgan	Number 1.0.
	Hermes	Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point--
	Number 1.0	[waggling his finger] D-D-D-D-Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation's in. We kept it grey.
	Hermes	Sir, please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it.
	Number 1.0	Very well. But your bureaucratic licence will be revoked if you fail to sort the master in pile by closing time: 1pm.
	Leela	That's only four minutes from now.
	Hermes	Requisition me a beat.[Number 1.0 plays some music and Hermes slides down a tube onto the in pile.](singing) When I was four there was a hurricane in Kingston Town,With a foot and a half of water,Everyone was alright but I cried all night,It blew my alphabet blocks out of order,And they said, "This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,Born to be all obsessive and snotty,"I made my friends and relations file long applications,To get into my 10th birthday party.
	LaBarbara	[singing] But something changed when my man turned pro.
	Hermes	[singing] I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.
	LaBarbara	[singing] He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks.
	Hermes	[singing] It's supposed to be about the filing! People![He jumps onto Number 1.0's desk and starts juggles the tubes.]We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,No, that's what almighty Jah made us,We treat people like swine,And make 'em stand in line,Even if nobody paid us!
	Hermes	[singing] They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats,They say we're anal, compulsive and weird,But when push comes to shove,You gotta do what you love,Even if it's not a good idea.[He slides down the pile and throws the red tubes around the other Planet Express staff like a knife thrower.]Zoidberg!
	Zoidberg	[singing] They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
	Professor Farnsworth	[singing] They pooh-poohed my electric frankfurter.
	Leela	[singing] They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.
	Bender	[mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
	Hermes	[singing] Everybody sing Jamaica!
	All	[singing] Jamaica!
	Hermes	Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!
	Bureaucrats	[singing] Jamaica!
	Hermes	[singing] The grade 19's!
	Morgan	Jamaica.
	Hermes	[singing] Sing me home!When push comes to shove,You gotta do what you love,Even if it's not a good idea!
	Bender	I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!
	Fry	Yeah!
	Zoidberg	Congratulations.
	Number 1.0	Congratulations indeed but you finished with one second to spare so I'm demoting you. A good bureaucrat never finishes early.
	Amy	That's OK, Hermes. At least we have you back.
	Morgan	Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second--
	Hermes	Not so fast! While I was sorting I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B: Notification of Romantic Entanglement.
	Fry	That's right, she fraternised me!
	Morgan	That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment.
	Hermes	Yes, but you only stamped it four times!
	Morgan	No! No! I was young and reckless.
	Number 1.0	Bureaucrat Conrad, you are technically correct -- the best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37. [He changes Hermes' badge to 37. He points at Morgan.] And as for you. [shouting] Guards! [Guards surround Morgan.] [talking] Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely-reduced pay, of course.
	LaBarbara	It's better than nothing.
	Fry	What about me? Can I come back at severely-reduced pay?
	Hermes	You got it, mon! In fact, severely-reduced pay all around! [The staff cheer and Hermes hops on a slow-mobile.] Come on, wife, let's blow this joint!
	Zoidberg	Now it's time for my song! [singing] When I was two, there was a tidal wave in--
	Zoidberg	[over credits] Aw.
