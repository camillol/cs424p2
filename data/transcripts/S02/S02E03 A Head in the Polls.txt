	Narrator	[voice-over; on TV] You're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location. [A stopwatch and telephone fly past.] The kind of place where there might be a monster or some kind of weird mirror. [An old boot, a man shampooing his hair and a half-eaten drumstick fly past.] These are just examples. It could also be something much better. [A door rotates towards the camera in the centre of the picture.] Prepare to enter The Scary Door. [The door opens onto the titles, which shatter like glass. The show begins and the first scene is a pan over a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The camera glides past smoking rubble.] As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth.
	Man	[on TV] Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity. [His glasses break.] It's not fair! It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print books. [His eyes fall out and he screams.] It's not f-- Well, lucky I know how to read Braille! [His hands fall off and he screams. Then his tongue falls out and finally his head comes off.] Hey, look at that weird mirror!
	Bender	Cursed by his own hubris!
	Leela	There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!
	Bender	Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!
	Announcer	[voice-over; on TV] C-SPAN9 presents: The Thrill Of Politics.
	Leela	Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world.
	Fry	What do we care? We live in the United States.
	Leela	The United States is part of the world.
	Fry	Wow! I have been gone a long time.
	Johnson	[on TV] It's time someone had the courage to stand up and say: "I'm against those things that everybody hates".
	Jackson	[on TV] Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with everything he just said!
	Fry	These are the candidates? They sound like clones. [He looks a little harder.] Wait a minute. They are clones!
	Leela	Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
	Johnson	[on TV] I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.
	Jackson	[on TV] And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!
	Fry	If I were registered to vote, I'd send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown.
	Leela	You're not registered?
	Fry	Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides, it's not like one vote ever made a difference.
	Leela	That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote.
	Bender	Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
	Prof. Farnsworth	But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
	Leela	The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register!
	Fry	Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?
	Prof. Farnsworth	The very instant I became old.
	Prof. Farnsworth	The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
	Fry	The less fortunate get all the breaks!
	Zoidberg	You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe.
	Amy	Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
	Zoidberg	Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
	Fry	What party do you belong to, Bender?
	Bender	I'm not allowed to vote.
	Fry	'Cause you're a robot?
	Bender	No, convicted felon.
	Woman	We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet.
	Fry	OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?
	Woman	Attach Brain Slugs to them.
	Fry	[sarcastic] Sure, you say that now!
	Amy	So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?
	Stoned Guy	Dave's not here, man.
	Amy	I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.
	Stoned Guy	It does? No way! I gotta check out this brochure!
	Prof. Farnsworth	So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?
	N.R.A. Man	Well, first off, we're gonna get rid of that three-day waiting period for mad scientists.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?
	N.R.A. Man	Amen, brother. I don't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax ... [He takes a vial of the stuff out of his pocket.] ... for duck hunting.
	Zoidberg	Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?
	Hermes	I concur.
	Fry	Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
	V.A.P. Man	Sorry, not with that attitude.
	Fry	[downbeat] OK then, screw it.
	V.A.P. Man	Welcome aboard, brother!
	Fry	[excited] Alright!
	V.A.P. Man	You're out.
	Fry	That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
	Linda	[on TV] And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's mind is who will be the next President of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?
	Morbo	[on TV] All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo.
	Linda	[on TV] In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn's moon of Titan today, when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers.
	Bender	What? Lord have mercy!
	Linda	[on TV] Unless something is done quickly, the trapped robots will be dead within 300 years. [She turns to a screen where a mine spokesman is stood outside the collapsed mine. Trapped robots wave their arms behind him.] Sir, what rescue operations are planned?
	Mine Spokesman	[on TV] The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with our lives.
	Morbo	[on TV] News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.
	Bender	Alright! I'm rich!
	Leela	What are you talking about?
	Bender	My body's 40% titanium! [He bangs his chest cabinet.] I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
	Fry	Too bad you can't spend it.
	Bender	[ironic] Oh, can't I?
	Fry	No.
	Bender	Watch me, poor man.
	Pawnbroker	[from inside] Pleasure doing business with you.
	Bender	Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves! [A dog sniffs his head.] Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing. [The dog cocks it's leg and Bender chuckles.] You just lost five dollars!
	Bender	Hey, buddy. Little help? [The man kicks Bender into the air.] [shouting] Thank you!
	Bender	Hello, peasants.
	Leela	Bender? What happened to you?
	Fry	Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?
	Bender	No, I sold my body.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants.
	Fry	This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?
	Bender	Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
	Fry	Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.
	Bender	Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?
	Bender	Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.
	Bender	Shaken, not stirred. [The man shakes his head.] Aw, yeah!
	Bender	Put it all on black.
	Croupier	21 red. [Bender moves so his antenna points to another number.] I beg your pardon. 33 black.
	Bender	Yes! The rich get richer!
	Bender	Strike! In your face, Leela! [He laughs. Leela rolls her ball and it hits Bender.] Ow!
	Bender	[shouting] Timber!
	Fry	Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?
	Bender	Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!
	Fry	Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
	Bender	I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things: poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers! [He revs the engine but the car careens out of control. Bender's head falls out and the car crashes into a plant pot.] Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?
	Bender	Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?
	Schiffer	Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.
	Fry	I recognise you. Didn't you use to have a body of some sort?
	Schiffer	Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue.
	Fry	Well, you're looking great.
	Schiffer	Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.
	Fry	[shrugging] Couldn't hurt.
	Bender	Ah, US presidents. [Leela sets his head down next to George Washington.] Sturdy shelves, good security. [Two bodyguard heads look at him.] This place has class.
	Bill Clinton	[to Leela] Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts as sex anymore.
	Ford	I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women.
	Fry	[to Clinton] Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.
	Ford	Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.
	Richard Nixon	No kidding, Ford.
	Bender	So then the hookerbot says, "That's not my expansion slot" and my friend says, "That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"
	Washington	Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up.
	Bender	You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?
	George H.W. Bush	Sorry, Bender, but we just can't allow every Tom, Dick, and Harry to move in. No offence, Jefferson, Nixon and Truman.
	Carter	Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers.
	Dole	Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the "knock knock" jokes.
	Bender	Pass.
	Washington	So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?
	Bender	I hocked it.
	Washington	Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?
	Bender	Same reason you hocked your teeth.
	Washington	Ah. Booze money.
	Richard Nixon	I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it.
	Fry	I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but-- Ooh!
	Leela	Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.
	Bender	So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?
	Richard Nixon	No, son. It's a sad and lonely life.
	Bender	Oh, great. Now you tell me!
	Richard Nixon	That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!
	Bender	[sleep-talking] Ones ... zeros ... one, one, zero, zero, one--
	Fry	Bender, what is it?
	Bender	Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.
	Fry	It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.
	Bender	I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!
	Bender	You sold my body? To who?
	Pawnbroker	I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid.
	Fry	Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!
	Pawnbroker	Deal.
	Bender	[crying] Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Don't you have a self-destruct button?
	Bender	[crying] Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?
	Fry	Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!
	Richard Nixon	[on TV] And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing my candidacy for the presidency of Earth.
	Journalist #1	Just one question.
	Scoop Chang	Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that nobody can be elected president more than twice.
	Richard Nixon	That's right. Nobody. [He steps out from behind his podium.] But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!
	Bender	Oh!
	Leela	Bender, he's got your body!
	Bender	That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!
	Leela	Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
	Fry	Yeah, and that electric guitar.
	Richard Nixon	[singing; on TV] Remember what the dormouse said,Feed your head.(talking) I'm meeting you half way, you stupid hippies! [Cheers from the crowd.] I am not a crook's head!
	Bender	Yeah, you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!
	Leela	Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot.
	Morbo	Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates: Puny Human #1, Puny Human #2, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
	Richard Nixon	Hello, Morbo. How's the family?
	Morbo	Belligerent and numerous.
	Richard Nixon	Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
	Bender	Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.
	Leela	Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
	Morbo	Morbo demands an answer to the following question: If you saw delicious candy in the hands of a small child would you seize and consume it?
	Johnson	Unthinkable.
	Jackson	I wouldn't think of it.
	Morbo	What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you, you are under a truth-o-scope.
	Richard Nixon	Uh, well, I, uh ... the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether anyone is watching or, uh... [He clears his throat.] At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm the child.
	Campaign Manager	You scored big points tonight, sir.
	Richard Nixon	What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there.
	Campaign Manager	Yes, but your body stayed on message. And that message is, "Look at my shiny new body". The robots ate it up. You've got real charisma from the neck down.
	Richard Nixon	Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!
	Bender	Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!
	Richard Nixon	Now, look here, you drugged-out Communist. I paid for this body and I'd no sooner return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers. [The dog's head in a jar barks.] Shut up, damnit!
	Fry	Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.
	Bender	That was a good one!
	Richard Nixon	Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!
	Bender	[crying] It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
	Fry	No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!
	Leela	I've got a better plan.
	Fry	[whispering] Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
	Leela	[whispering] They give you a discount if you've been here before.
	Fry	Keep going, we're right behind you.
	Bender	Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!
	Man	[from inside] We're in a room!
	Bender	Well then lose some weight.
	Richard Nixon	[sleep-talking] Aroo!
	Richard Nixon	[sleep-talking] Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!
	Bender	[whispering] Psst! There I am!
	Richard Nixon	[sleep-talking] Hey, Betty Friedan, send a little of that lotion my way!
	Leela	OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.
	Fry	Ooh! [Below, some more writing says "Thought Activated".] Uh-oh!
	Richard Nixon	What the-- [Fry smiles weakly at Leela.] You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!
	Bender	I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
	Richard Nixon	Bring it on, soup can.
	Leela	Alright, break it up, you two!
	Richard Nixon	That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a pardon like that sissy, Ford.
	Leela	You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
	Richard Nixon	Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place.
	Fry	Well, he lost my vote.
	Richard Nixon	Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police.
	Bender	Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?
	Richard Nixon	Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.
	Richard Nixon	[on tape] And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!
	Richard Nixon	My God? I really sound like that? I thought my voice had more of a Clark Gable quality.
	Leela	The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body.
	Richard Nixon	Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal.
	Fry	Hey, I've got one last thought.
	Bender	Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off.
	Linda	[on TV] The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to its highest level in centuries. 6%
	Morbo	[on TV] Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with an estimated zero votes.
	Leela	Yes! The system works!
	Linda	[on TV] The time is 7:59 and the robot polls are now opening ... and the robot vote is in. Nixon has won!
	Leela	No!
	Fry	What?
	Bender	Get out of town!
	Fry	Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
	Campaign Manager	I give you the next president of Earth!
	Richard Nixon	[shouting] Nixon's back!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
	Bender	Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.
	Fry	Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
	Leela	Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today.
	Morbo	[on TV] Morbo congratulates our gargantuan cyborg president. May death come quickly to his enemies.
	Richard Nixon	Aroo! Who's kicking who around now? [He rips away the fence outside the White House.] Aroo! Aroo!
	Richard Nixon	Knock, knock!
