	Cubert	Yes, 10!
	Dwight	Well done, Cubonius. You decapitated the unicorn.
	ALL	All right.
	Chinese Boy	Oh, oh! We search his tail pouch for treasure.
	Dwight	Deep in the unicorn's rump sack, you find... [The boys gasp as he rolls the dice.] 60 gold pieces.
	Chinese Boy	Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
	Cubert	I cast a spell of detect magic.
	Bender	[Walking over to the table.] What you doing, mini-meatbags? Underage gambling? Shame on you. Count me in. [He places a wad of cash on the table.]
	Cubert	Right now, we're fighting for our lives in the lair of the Dragon Queen.
	Bender	Ah, wrong. Right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair.
	Cubert	Yes, but in my imagination I'm riding a golden Pegasus. Giddy up, Sparky! [He rides the chair like a horse.]
	Dwight	Bender, were you built without an imagination?
	Bender	What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet.
	Bender	Fry, do I have an imagination?
	Fry	I don't know, Bender. Why do you ask? Were the other boys making fun of you?
	Bender	Mhmm. They said I couldn't imagine things.
	Fry	Well, you never know unless you try. Like, I didn't know if I could swallow a softball, so I gave it my best shot and voilà! [He lifts his shirt to reveal a large lump in the middle of his abdomen.] Wait, that's not it. [He twists to the left a bit to reveal a second hump.] Ah, thar she blows!
	Ship's Computer	(while beeping): Warning, out of dark matter fuel.
	Leela	That's not a warning. A warning is supposed to come before something bad happens.
	Ship's Computer	(with a more stern alarm): Warning, engines will shut down in one second.
	Leela	That's more like it.
	Fry	Uh-oh. This space neighborhood looks kind of sketchy.
	Punk	[He flies onto the front of the ship and yanks off the hood ornament.] Rock 'n' roll.
	Bender	Hey, that punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know we have the LX package.
	Leela	We need dark matter and we need it fast. Fry, check Nibbler's litter box. Maybe he dropped a steamer.
	Fry	Aye, aye, Captain. Yes! I've never been so excited to see poop. Well, maybe once.
	ALL	[Cheering]
	Bender	There's gas in our ass.
	Leela	Can you believe the price of dark matter? It'd be cheaper to fill the tank with Nobel Prize winners' sperm.
	MOM COMPUTER	$632.14. Your Speedpass will now be charged.
	Leela	You lousy...
	Sal	Hey, gets a loads of that ugly ship. What shades of green is that? Puke?
	Leela	For your information it's called Electric Mucus.
	Hoschel	More like puke.
	Sal	Whoa!
	Leela	Why don't you come a little closer so my boot can hear you?
	Bender	[Restraining her.] Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog.
	Sal	What's the matters, you couldn't affords the LX package?
	Hoschel	Puke-a-doodle-do.
	seen Mickey Rourke's head.	You're making fun of our ship? Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head.
	Sal	Yeah, she's a little Rourky, but you got to gets big time ugly to be five-time winners at a demolition derby.
	Fry	That's five more times than we've won or even entered.
	Bender	We do suck.
	Sal	Yup, and it's gonna be six winses after tonights.
	Leela	We'll sees abouts that.
	Hermes	Dark matter costs have tripled, so we must reduce expenses. Therefore, we will no longer provide complimentary porno magazines in the lounge.
	Scruffy	Dern it.
	Professor Farnsworth	And no more wasting fuel. From now on I'll be keeping a tight hold on the keys to the ship, swallowing them before I go to bed and recovering them the next morning.
	Amy	Splech!
	Hermes	Professor, it's 4:00.
	Professor Farnsworth	4:00 in the evening? Then, good night. [He swallows the keys.]
	Zoidberg	But won't that turn our ship into a piece of junk?
	Bender	Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela.
	Leela	But we have no choice. Rednecks insulted us.
	Fry	So? Let it go. Don't let your temper get the better of...
	Leela	[Grabbing Fry and shaking him senseless.] Rednecks!
	Zoidberg	Using this magneto, I will now guide the keys up the thorax and out via the frontal face hole. That's the storage locker, the boat, the other boat, pay dirt!
	Rich Little	(VO): Greetings, sports fans. Though whether this outpouring of inbreds can in fact be classified as a sport is a subject of no small scholarly debate.
	Sal	Well, wells, well, if it ain'ts Princess Pukerella and her pukey puke-mobile.
	Leela	Oh, yeah? Well... Shut up.
	Bender	-Good comeback, Leela.
	Leela	You shut up, too.
	Rich Little	Rich Little, here, as Howard Cosell. And now to grace us with its rendition of the national anthem, please welcome what is left of the Dixie Chicks after their tragic matter transporter accident.
	The Dixie Chicks	We're in horrible pain.
	Sal	Whoas!
	Leela	Yes! Now we're inflicting.
	Rich Little	(VO): Outstanding! Tonight we are witnessing a veritable clinic and that ludicrous hullabaloo known as demolition derby.
	George Takei	[While smacking into a ship piloted by Scott Bakula.] Way to kill the franchise, Bakula. [He hits him one more time and then sees it explode. Not long after, Takei's ship explodes as well.]
	Leela	Buckle your sphincters.
	Sal	That broad's insanes.
	Hoschel	But you're insansier, right?
	Sal	Nah, I guess nots. I've decideds to relax and enjoy life from now ons.
	Rich Little	Planet Express takes the trophy.
	Leela	Now, I'll use the magnet to get the keys back in there.
	Zoidberg	What? You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing? [He begins placing organs back in Farnsworth's body.]
	Leela	(Into her Wristlojakimater): Leela to Zoidberg. Execute Distraction Protocol Alpha.
	Zoidberg	(From Wristlojakimater): Roger that.
	Zoidberg	Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Ooh! [He falls and lands against the curtain. A torch sits next to him.] Don't look at me.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, she's a wonderful ship, all right. As beautiful now as the day I got botched laser eye surgery. [He looks at the floor.] Now, that's odd. What's the fuel gauge doing on the fl... [He gasps as he sees the gauge points at the notch just below the "Full" mark.] Great Godzilla's gonads! Who wasted precious fuel? Answer now or be punished.
	Leela	All right, fine. I admit it.
	Professor Farnsworth	You will be punished.
	Chinese Boy	Oh, my gosh, 20!
	Dwight	Your pole arm does double damage, and the gelatinous cube dies in horrible poverty. [He makes dying noises.]
	Indian Boy	Most ingenious.
	Chinese Boy	Ah, Bender?
	Bender	Me? I, uh cast a spell of darkness. [He makes ghostly noises.] Pretty imaginative, huh?
	Cubert	No, you just did the same thing as me, but with a dumb noise.
	Bender	Oh... You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't.
	Dwight	Yes, you can. You just have to lose yourself in the fantasy. You have to believe the impossible is merely preposterous.
	Bender	Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I believe, I believe. [He makes ghostly noises again.] I did it! I imagined something. For 1.3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder.
	Chinese Boy	Way to go, Bender.
	Cubert	What is thy character's name, good sir?
	Bender	Uh, um... I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
	Professor Farnsworth	(Angrily): Everybody out of the conference room. I am calling a conference. (To the crew:) Everybody get in here. [Cut to Leela standing with the crew and Farnsworth.] You wasted precious fuel just because you were insulted by some redneck yokel from beyond the stars?
	Leela	It was only half a ball.
	Professor Farnsworth	That's not the point. Your temper is out of control. And to think I'd have never even known if it weren't for the lengthy and unsolicited tattling of Dr. Zoidberg.
	Zoidberg	She also took home two rolls of Scotch tape.
	Professor Farnsworth	Thank you, Dr. Zoidberg. Hermes, incentivize that employee.[Hermes throws a fish into Zoidberg's mouth.] As for you, Leela, I'm letting you off with a warning.
	Leela	Oh, thank you.
	Professor Farnsworth	A warning that will be administered by this 50,000-volt shock collar.
	Leela	Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be... [She is shocked.] Ow!
	Professor Farnsworth	The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. [She is shocked.]
	Professor Farnsworth	Profanity.
	Leela	Son of a... [She is shocked.] Ow!
	Professor Farnsworth	Or perversions of a sexual nature.
	Leela	[She is silent for a moment, then is shocked.] Ow!
	Hermes	It's the only collar they had in stock at Office Depot.
	Zoidberg	 :I hope you picked up some Scotch tape while you were there.
	Bender	That's a good one.
	Narrator	Imagine, if you will, an announcer you can barely understand. He refers to a... *incoherent mumbling* But you're not quite sure what he said. He seems to be eating something, or perhaps he's a little drunk. It's remotely possible that he just said something about... The Scary Door.
	Soldier	Firing, sir!
	Soldier	It's all over. Our guns and bombs are useless against the aliens.
	Farmer	The saucers! Theys'a crashin'!
	Narrator	In the end, it was not guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
	Leela	I can't believe TiVo suggested that piece of... [She is shocked.] Ow! Come on, Hermes. Surely you have the authority to remove this damn [The collar shocks her, but it goes unnoticed.] collar.
	Hermes	Alas, no. I got the key but not the authority.
	Leela	[She reaches for the key and gets shocked.] Yeow! Well, who does have the authority?
	Hermes	Only the staff doctor. You'll have to convince him that you have resolved your anger issues.
	Leela	I don't have any god da- [Shock.] mother f- [Shock.] anger issues. [Smoke is coming from the collar.]
	Indian Boy	What do we do? What do we do?
	Bender	Wait, I know. I make use of my rod of fireballs. [He makes explosion noises.]
	Cubert	[He scoffs.] Everyone knows red dragons are immune to fireballs as well as all other forms of incendiary attack.
	Bender	Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape.
	ALL	Whoa!
	Dwight	[He rolls the dice.] Sweet pony of Sierra Leone, it worked!
	Chinese Boy	We did it!
	Cubert	Success!
	Fry	Bender, smell this milk.
	Bender	I go not by the name of Bender, you fleshy fool. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.
	Fry	Professor, something's bothering me.
	Monkey	(In Farnsworth's Voice): Well, you can always talk to me about anything, Fry. What's on your mind?
	Fry	Well, it's... it's about my friend Bender.
	Farnsworth Monkey	Mmm. I see. Show me on this anatomically correct doll exactly where he touched you.
	Fry	No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I am worried about him. He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons & Dragons.
	Farnsworth Monkey	Dungeons &... Good God! Hasn't he seen the Afterschool Special? You've got to talk to him, Fry. Make him quit now before he completely loses his mind.
	Fry	Okay, I will.
	Farnsworth Monkey	Good boy. Just don't let him touch you down there.
	Zoidberg	Well, here's your problem, right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head.
	Leela	[Annoyed sigh.] You're absolutely right, Doctor. Can the collar come off now?
	Zoidberg	Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out. [He pulls a large potato peeler. He prepares to "fix" Leela's problem, but she gets angry and activates the shock collar while kicking the utensil out of his grip. It flies into the groin of an upside down poster of the human body.]
	Leela	I guess I would have to say, I hate you. [The collar emits a shock.]
	Leela	What? [The collar is intermittently shocking her now.]
	Leela	I was raised in an orphanarium. My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago.
	Zoidberg	Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out. Maybe have them cook me nice dinner. No scallions. I hate them. (To an intercom:) Amy, cancel my appointments.
	Amy	(From intercom): Stop calling me.
	Fry	Bender, please don't get mad, but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.
	Bender	You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I've decided to quit.
	Fry	Really? Whew! That's a load off my toad.
	Bender	Now, if you'll excuse me. [He places the pot on his head.] I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain. [He waves his arms around, makes gibbery noises and dives head first out the window. Cut to Hermaphrobot screwing her left breast in place under a street light. Bender falls in front of her, gets up and pulls a sword out from his chest.]
	Hermaphrobot	You couldn't afford it, honey. [She snaps her fingers.]
	Hermes	(from off screen): He also left a small pile of treasure on the living room rug.
	Bender	Foul dragon, meet thy doom.
	Turanga Munda	Would you like a napkin, Doctor?
	Zoidberg	Thank you.
	Leela	Satisfied, Zoidberg? My relationship with my parents is fine.
	Turanga Munda	Now, hold on, Leela. Maybe this torture collar is good for you.
	Leela	What? [ she is shocked.] Ow!
	Turanga Munda	It'll control your temper. Men like a woman who's not always slamming their head in the car door.
	Turanga Morris	She's right. That's what first attracted me to your mother. [He laughs and Leela's collar emits a shock.]
	Leela	Mom, he's a cockroach from outer space. [A large shock is dispensed and Leela screams.]
	Fry	Ha-have you seen Bender? He's gone nuts. Also, smell this milk.
	Bender	Prepare for a surprise attack.
	Zoidberg	Someone do something.
	Leela	I would, but... [She is shocked.] Ow! Take my collar off.
	Zoidberg	I can't, I'm still eating. [He shovels food into his mouth and Bender attacks him by smashing his head with the shield.] Help me, Leela.
	Bender	I cast upon thee a spell of fireball! [He burps behind a lit candle in Leela's direction. The fireball sets the couch, then house on fire. Bender has them cornered and uses his arm as a bow to fire utensils at the group. The all struggle to dodge the shots, but a spoon strike Zoidberg in the forehead. Bender readies to fire a spork.]
	Fry	[Standing in front of the group with a ladle in his hand.] Beholdeth, Titanius, I cast a freeze ray upon you.
	Bender	[He scoffs.] That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a "freeze ray." What, you mean a cone of coldness?
	Fry	Yeah, that.
	Bender	No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness. [He acts like he's about to freeze.] I'm freezing... what? Ah! [His body goes ridged and falls over.]
	Zoidberg	Relax, Fry. I'm a doctor. I'm sure the robut will be just fine with a little help.
	Bender	Help, help. [Cut to reveal he's in a padded cell in a straight jacket.] (Echoing:) Help! [Cut to show the exterior of his cell. Cut to exterior shot of the HAL Institute - For Criminally Insane Robots.]
