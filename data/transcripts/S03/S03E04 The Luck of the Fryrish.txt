	Doctor	Push, Mrs. Fry. You're almost there.
	Mr. Fry	You can do it, honey! Squeeze one out for America.
	Mrs. Fry	[shouting] Hey, keep it down! It's the 9th inning.
	Commentator	[on radio] Here's the 02 pitch to Craypool. He's taking all the way for a called strike three!
	Mrs. Fry	Swing the bat, you bum!
	Doctor	It's a boy. And look at that red hair!
	Mr. Fry	You sayin' my son's a commie?
	Commentator	[on radio] And Grote leans into the pitch. It hits him! The Mets win!
	Mrs. Fry	This is the happiest day of my life!
	Doctor	Here's your baby, ma'am.
	Mrs. Fry	Yeah, OK, thanks.
	Mr. Fry	So, what should we name him?
	Mrs. Fry	Uh, you pick. I picked dinner last night.
	Mr. Fry	Well, I was thinking of Philip. After those screwdrivers?
	Mrs. Fry	That's a fantastic idea. More morphine, please.
	Mr. Fry	Look, Yancy, it's your baby brother, Philip.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	I wanna be named Philip! Me Philip! Me Philip!
	Mr. Fry	Son, your name is Yancy, just like me and my grandfather and so on. All the way back to minuteman Yancy Fry, who blasted commies in the American Revolution. [Yancy salutes. Mr. Fry attaches a mobile to Philip's bed. It has planets and a spaceship on it.] Philip, until I find a suitable model of an ICBM, you'll have to make do learnin' to fear this toy spacecraft.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Mine! Mine!
	Fry	[shouting] C'mon!
	Hermes	[shouting] Baby needs a new pair of shoes!
	Zoidberg	To hell with your spoiled baby! I need those shoes!
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] And it's a dead heat! They're checking the electron microscope. And the winner is ... [A man holds up a "3" in a window.] ... number 3, in a quantum finish.
	Prof. Farnsworth	No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.
	Leela	How'd you do, Fry?
	Fry	I'll tell you when my horse finishes ... bad.
	Mr. Wong	In today's field we own four horses and two jockeys.
	Mrs. Wong	We just put our best jockey out to stud, Amy. He's perfect for you!
	Jockey	Hey, baby! Ever do it in a suitcase?
	Bender	Ooh! Look! It's the Centaur race.
	Fry	Come on! Come on! Hey, Leela, how about a kiss for good luck? [Leela sighs and reluctantly kisses him on the cheek.] I meant tongue luck.
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] And the winner is number four -- Steven.
	Fry	I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
	Paper-hatted salesman	[shouting] Get your piping-hot horse burgers, horse fries, horse cake and shakes. We got tongue straight from the horse's mouth.
	Leela	Hmm.
	Hermes	It all sounds good.
	Paper-hatted salesman	All our horses are 100% horse-fed for that double-horse juiced-in goodness.
	Leela	I'll have the cholesterol-free omelette with horse beaters.
	Paper-hatted salesman	And you, sir, how can I horse you?
	Hermes	I'll have a horse coke.
	Paper-hatted salesman	Horse Pepsi OK?
	Hermes	Nay.
	Jockey	Hey! What are you doing?
	Bender	This.
	Fry	Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you. Sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. [The bell rings and only one horse leaves the box. The other horses stumble out tiredly. Bender chuckles.] Come on, number six! Move it! [Number six yawns and sits down.] Don't do that! What are you-- [He yawns.] Man, it's contagious!
	Announcer	[on loudspeaker] And the winner is Harry Trotter by the entire racetrack.
	Bender	That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
	Fry	That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough. [He reaches into his shirt.] I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding on to! [A sudden gust of wind takes the dollar from his hand.] Oh, no you don't! [The dollar falls into a Slurm machine and comes back out and flies away again. It comes to rest on an overhead wire. Fry climbs the pole.] I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar! [He reaches over to the dollar but it is out of reach. He climbs down the pole and returns with a rake.] If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J.--
	Paper-hatted salesman	That is one unlucky guy!
	Fry	Kareem's got the sky hook but Philip J. Fry's got the space hook!
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Yancy drives; he goes up with his patented space hook!
	Fry	Hey! That's my patented space hook! You stole it!
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	You're not the president of it!
	Fry	Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover!
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	[shouting; mocking] I'm dying of old age!
	Fry	Game over! Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy-dome!
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Lucky.
	Leela	Well, someone's in a good mode.
	Bender	Let's just say I lucked-out at the track! Also, I rigged one race.
	Fry	Pah! I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven-leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.
	Hairbot	I got your page, Mr. Fry. Your new hair is ready.
	Amy	So whatever happened to this seven-leaf clover?
	Fry	I hid it in a secret hiding place whose location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
	Zoidberg	So the clover is still in the hiding place, maybe?
	Fry	Hey, yeah! Maybe it is still there. Underground in the ruins of Old New York, helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn its luck around.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Dirt doesn't need luck.
	Fry	I'm going down there to get my clover back. Some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela, how 'bout you?
	Leela	Sure. I'll do it.
	Bender	Like hell you will! Bending's my middle name.
	Fry	It is?
	Bender	Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodríguez.
	Fry	Here's the entrance. [He steps onto the ladder in the manhole.] From this moment on, I declare my bad luck officially over.
	Bender	He was fun.
	Leela	Well, if we get bored looking for the clover, I've got Tetris on this thing.
	Fry	Look, up ahead.
	Bender	Old New York: The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
	Fry	Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing. [He stands on top of a newspaper box.] [shouting] Howard Stern is overrated! [He laughs and runs to a phone box and deliberately knocks the receiver off.] Uh, oops!
	Bender	New York is so burned.
	Fry	And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?
	Leela	No.
	Fry	Well, Rudy, how do you like this action?
	Teen #1	As you know, the big breakdance is Saturday. So if we wanna win those Jam Master J autographed parachute pants, our crew has to pop, lock and bust the freshest. Noticeably F.A.T., drop us a beat. [Noticeably F.A.T. makes beat box noises. Fry steps up.] Name?
	Fry	Cosmic F.
	Teen #1	Style?
	Fry	Outer space.
	Teen #1	Special moves?
	Fry	[dancing] The moonwalk ... the robot ... the zero G.
	Teen #1	Name?
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Cosmic Y.
	Teen #1	Style?
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Uh, deep space!
	Fry	Deep space?
	Teen #1	Special moves?
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	The spacewalk...
	Fry	Hey!
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	The robot...
	Fry	The robot? That's similar to mine!
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	The zero G.
	Fry	What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	You callin' me a biter?
	Fry	Why do you always have to steal everything from me, Yancy? Find your own life and live it.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Stop illin'! Word!
	Fry	Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. The septuple-head-spin.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	He's just scratching. No one's ever done more than a quadruple.
	Fry	Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape.
	Teen #1	Crazy sucker!
	Teen #2	Phil, you're hot!
	Noticeably F.A.T.	That was ice cold, bro!
	Teen #1	Fry, if I ever see you try anything that crazy again, this crew might just have some new parachute pants!
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Stop hogging the clover.
	Fry	Alright, team, let's go find that clover!
	Leela	Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st Street.
	Fry	71st Street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction.
	Bender	No sweat. We'll just take a spin on the B-train!
	Bender	Ooh! That feels funny! [Fry and Leela climb onto him and he gets an intercom out of his chest cabinet and speaks into it.] This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
	Bender	Wake up, buddy. End of the line!
	Fry	Gosh! My old neighbourhood. [They walk down a deserted street and Fry points at things.] That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!
	Bender	Was it poorly Xeroxed?
	Fry	You'd better believe it!
	Leela	The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from L.A.
	Mutant	Pardon me, but did I overhear you saying you used to live here?
	Fry	That's right.
	Mutant	Did you know Andy Goldman?
	Fry	Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?
	Mutant	I mutated from him!
	Fry	Get outta here! What's Andy up to these days?
	Andy	The short answer is I'm teaching.
	Leela	He seemed nice.
	Fry	Sure. When he's sober!
	Fry	Holy camolies! The house I grew up in. It's still there!
	Bender	Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage! Give it! Give it! Give it!
	Fry	[shouting; from outside] Mom! Help!
	Mrs. Fry	Yes!
	Fry	Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover.
	Mrs. Fry	[uninterested] Yancy, stealing is wrong.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Come back here, you! I'm gonna pile drive you! [Fry runs into the basement and locks the door behind him.] You're dead meat!
	Mr. Fry	What's happenin' up there? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?
	Fry	Not yet, commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual.
	Mr. Fry	Well he'd better keep his hands off these bananas. Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys.
	Fry	The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back. [He opens the vault, flips through some records and takes one out.] Ah, The Breakfast Club soundtrack. Man, I can't wait till I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff. [He slips the clover into the record sleeve and puts it back into the vault and closes it.] Stay safe, clover. I may need you again someday.
	Fry	This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
	Leela	And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
	Bender	What a waste.
	Fry	This is it. My Ronco Record Vault. [He blows the dust off it.] I still remember the combination: Three. [He turns the dial and tries to open the door.] It's stuck!
	Bender	The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. Allow me. [He cracks his knuckles, puts his hand on the top of the vault and starts vibrating it. The room starts to shake around them, plaster falls from the ceiling and furniture shakes. Leela looks around. Bender's head vibrates right off his body and lands on the floor. The vault door opens.] There we go!
	Fry	Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
	Bender	You mean "breakfast club sandwich"?
	Fry	I hid my seven-leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it. [He takes a deep breath.] Here goes. [He reaches into the sleeve.] It's gone! [He takes the record out and sticks his head into the sleeve.] The whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!
	Leela	How do you know it didn't disintegrate?
	Fry	Everything else in here held up OK.
	Bender	Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
	Fry	I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
	Leela	Oh, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen.
	Fry	You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that--
	Bender	Who is that God-like figure?
	Fry	It's my brother, Yancy! And there, in his lapel, my seven-leaf clover! I knew he stole it.
	Leela	Hold the phone. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry?
	Fry	Wait a second. That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
	Bender	Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars.
	Fry	First person on Mars? I should have been the first person on Mars. He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life. [He punches the statue.] And now he broke my hand!
	Bender	His legend lives on.
	Prof. Farnsworth	So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
	Bender	Yep. Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.
	Leela	Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on.
	Fry	That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.
	Leela	You went there this morning for doughnuts.
	Hermes	First person on Mars? Oh, so your brother was that Philip J. Fry.
	Fry	I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Shut up, friends. My Internet browser heard us saying the word "Fry" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us. [The staff gather around.] It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries.
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] Philip J. Fry: Astronaut, philanthropist, entrepreneur was a great man truly worthy of narration. Fry was the first man on Mars ... [The scene changes to a man planting the American flag on Mars.] ... a feat that has never since been equalled.
	Fry	That should have been me!
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] The ever-lucky Fry made his fortune after striking oil in the bathroom of the mansion he had won in a lottery.
	Fry	That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] After a whirlwind fling with Icelandic supermodel Njörd, Fry scored a string of top 10 hits with his rock band Leaf Seven, known for their hypnotic rhythms, driving baselines and memorable hooks.
	Fry	That's what I'm known for!
	Man	[in movie] Phil came in, right, strummed out this tune, yeah, and I said, "That's a number one record!"
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] Today, Fry spends most of his time in his grave in Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery, buried with the trademark seven-leaf clover that will bring him luck in the next life, perhaps some Egyptians believe.
	Fry	So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbiting cemetery near here?
	Leela	It will be in a couple hours.
	Fry	Good. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.
	Bender	I'll get my kit.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Thanks for lending me your tux, Dad. It'll be perfect for my wedding.
	Mr. Fry	Yancy, that tux got me through 'Nam in style. [He sighs.] I just wish your brother were still around to see this.
	Mrs. Fry	I'll never forget the day Philip disappeared. Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 17-9. Oh, I miss him.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Oh, that reminds me: I was thinking I'd rummage through Phil's records for something to play at the wedding.
	Mrs. Fry	Have a look downstairs. Your brother may be missing but his crap sure isn't.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Hmm, Breakfast Club. This'll clear out the room at the end of the reception.
	Leela	They buried your brother in the World Heroes section? I'm impressed.
	Fry	I should be the one in that grave!
	Fry	Hmm. We lost Bender.
	Bender	There! Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine.
	Fry	Aha! My brother's grave!
	Leela	[reading] Philip Fry, the original Martian.
	Fry	It's all lies, every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?
	Bender	You're twice the the he ever was.
	Fry	It's clovering time!
	Yancy's Wife	So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Uh, I'm sorta thinking one. [She hands him the baby.] Daddy has a present for you today. Do you know what it is? [He pulls the clover out of his pocket.] It's a lucky clover that can help you be successful whatever you do -- even breakdancing -- and it once belonged to someone very special.
	Yancy's Wife	I know what name you wanna give him Yancy. It's OK.
	Yancy Fry, Jr.	Really? [She nods.] Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honour of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you, Philip, and I always will.
	Fry	[reading] Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit.
	Bender	Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring. [He puts it on and flashes it around.] Sorry, ladies, I'm taken! Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?
	Leela	Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.
	Bender	Alright, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
