	Announcer	[voice-over] Futurama is brought to you by ... [The oval retreats the right side of the screen and is replaced by a man with enormous teeth.] ... Thompson's Teeth: The only teeth strong enough to eat other teeth.
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order.
	Fry	[unenthusiastic] Huzzah!
	Leela	[unenthusiastic] Huzzah!
	Amy	[unenthusiastic] Huzzah!
	Zoidberg	Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
	Hermes	I will now read the mandatory speech. [He opens a book called "Minimum Obligations Manual".] [reading] Dear employee. Has it really been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please disregard this and get back to work. Distribute token of appreciation and applaud.
	Zoidberg	Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--
	Hermes	Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement. [He hands Zoidberg a piece of paper. Zoidberg reads it. He has accumulated a grand total of $0.00.] It's empty because you haven't paid into it, you dumb stinkbug!
	Zoidberg	You kept track of it all these years!
	Fry	Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?
	Bender	I thought you were retired.
	Fry	Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age.
	Bender	I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to "off".
	Fry	Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund. [He takes a $100 bill out of his sock.] Damn! Still only $100.
	Franklin	[on bill] A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot cream for my face?
	Fry	He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
	Fry	Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. [He scratches a panel on the "Whiff-n-Win" ticket.] Cherry. [Another panel.] Cherry! [The last one.] Mule. Crud!
	Bender	So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.
	Teller	You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ... [She sniffs.] ... mule farmer like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee.
	Fry	[shrugging] You gotta spend money to make money.
	Teller	Here you are, sir. Your account is now overdrawn by $4.
	Robot	Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank.
	Bender	That's for sure-- [He turns around.] Roberto! Is that you?
	Roberto	Bender! Hey, man!
	Bender	You old lunatic! How you been?
	Roberto	Not bad, not bad. [He pulls out a knife.] Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!
	Bender	Yeah, I'm doing OK too. [The teller hands Roberto several bags of money.] I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex.
	Roberto	Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
	Bender	Sure thing, pal.
	Roberto	Hey, you! Red! [He cuts the top off the plant.] Quit watering that plant and get the door!
	Bender	Well, nice talking to you.
	Roberto	Same here. [He takes the money from Bender and puts his arms around their shoulders.] You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble.
	Bender	Hey, thanks, buddy!
	Smitty	Freeze, punks! You're under arrest!
	Richard Nixon	[on $1000 bill] Shoot them in the back! Quick! While they're not looking!
	Bailiff	Court is in session. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
	Whitey	The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested. Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes, theft of money.
	Hyper-Chicken	As the surveillance camera for the bank what all the judge was a-jawing about, could y'all tell us what you done seen the day of the crime?
	Camera	Well, let's see. My memory's a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:
	Hyper-Chicken	Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients.
	Hyper-Chicken	Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?
	Fry	I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
	Leela	[shouting] Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
	Fry	You're right. You're right. It was--
	Whitey	Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you.
	Roberto	[on phone] ...and the other hamburger will...
	Roberto	...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal.
	Fry	I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patt√©.
	Whitey	Ah, the 67th Amendment.
	Hyper-Chicken	I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?
	Bender	A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
	Hyper-Chicken	If you start now, it might help our case.
	Whitey	Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?
	Hyper-Chicken	Well, for one, they done hired me to represent them.
	Whitey	Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured.
	Bender	Yahoo! The system fails again!
	Whitey	And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans.
	Bailiff	Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being poor is a mental illness.
	Whitey	[banging gavel] Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go.
	Fry	[from box] Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
	Professor Farnsworth	Keep your chin up!
	Fry	[from box] Ow! My chin!
	Fry	I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!
	Bender	Well, you meet half the qualifications.
	Fry	Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--
	Fry	What the--
	Bender	[shouting] I find that offensive!
	Dr. Perceptron	Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me give you something to help you relax.
	Fry	Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See? [He lifts up his gown and grabs his belly.] I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.
	Dr. Perceptron	Yes, you do. You need to relax more. [He gives Fry another shock.] Terrific. Now, consider the following: You were admitted to this robot asylum. Therefore, you must be a robot. Diagnosis complete.
	Fry	I do other human stuff! I age! See?
	Nurse Ratchet	I'm Nurse Ratchet. Please come with me, won't you?
	Nurse Ratchet	We'll meet your roommate next, shall we? His name is Malfunctioning Eddie.
	Fry	The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
	Nurse Ratchet	He's very excitable. [She takes the straight jacket off him and presses the open button on the door.] So don't say anything to excite him.
	Malfunctioning Eddie	Pleased to meet you.
	Fry	[shaking his hand] Actually, we've met once before.
	Malfunctioning Eddie	What?
	Hairbot	I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.
	Bender	Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
	Fry	My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?
	Bender	You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
	Fry	I don't wanna!
	Unit 2013	Hey, man. I believe you're a human.
	Fry	You do?
	Unit 2013	Sure. They don't believe I'm a human either. Name's Unit 2013. C'mon. Lemme introduce you around. [He takes Fry to a robot.] Fry, meet Norm. How's it going, pal? Still picking up transmissions from the CIA on your teeth?
	Norm	They just won't stop!
	Woman	[on radio] The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows: Monday, shepherd's pie. Tu--
	Unit 2013	[making "cuckoo" gesture] Cuckoo!
	Fry	Let me guess, he thinks he's Lincoln?
	Unit 2013	Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's got multiple personalities -- all of them Lincoln.
	Lincolnbot	I was born in 200 log cabins.
	Unit 2013	And this here is Frankie. He's convinced he's a lunchroom worker, so they put him to work in the lunchroom. [patronising] How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?
	Frankie	[shrugging] It's alright.
	Unit 2013	Poor Frankie!
	Mad Hatterbot	Change places!
	Fry	Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!
	Bender	Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon. [He sips some oil.] Ah! Sweet light crude!
	Fry	But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
	Bender	Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot.
	Mad Hatterbot	Change places!
	Victor	The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem.
	Malfunctioning Eddie	Well, the way I see it--
	Fry	You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot. [The Pay 'n' Chew robot coughs and a Bachelor Bar falls onto the floor.] Gimme! Gimme!
	Hermes	Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!
	Leela	We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
	Fry	At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
	Bender	Je suis Napoleon! [He laughs.] No, seriously, I'm not.
	Amy	Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
	Bender	Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour.
	Nurse Ratchet	Visiting hours are over. Time for our medication disks.
	Fry	[shouting] Help me! For God's sake, help me!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long.
	Fry	[sleep-talking] Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? [He hears a whirring outside and wakes up.] [talking] Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?
	Dr. Perceptron	You are being released.
	Fry	Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!
	Dr. Perceptron	Not you. Him.
	Malfunctioning Eddie	Me? What a surprise. [Fry flinches. There is a tiny explosion on Eddie's shoulder.] Look!
	Malfunctioning Eddie	I barely exploded at all.
	Dr. Perceptron	We can control that with medication.
	Nurse Ratchet	Fry? Are we ready to meet our new roommate?
	Roberto	Hi, Red!
	Fry	Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
	Roberto	I got busted robbing that bank again.
	Fry	[shaking] Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
	Roberto	Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little. [He sees Fry shaking.] What's the matter? You scared?
	Fry	N-- N-- N--
	Roberto	Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practise my stabbing.
	Fry	No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
	Bender	[shouting; from cell] Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
	Roberto	Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself a robot?
	Fry	I'm not a robot! [shouting] I'm not a robot!
	Dr. Perceptron	In answer to your question, Hermes, yes, your friend is cured.
	Hermes	Oh!
	Professor Farnsworth	What a relief!
	Leela	Thank God!
	Dr. Perceptron	You'll notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity.
	Fry	[mechanical voice] Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ...
	Leela	You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!
	Bender	[singing] Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. [talking] Bonjour, y'all!
	Zoidberg	Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!
	Fry	[mechanical voice] Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
	Leela	Oh, lots of reasons.
	Fry	[mechanical voice] Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment.
	Bender	Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
	Commentator	[on radio] And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!
	Bender	Come on, Lasty!
	Roberto	Hey, Bender.
	Bender	Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?
	Roberto	Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!
	Bender	Uh, sure. [He jumps on. Roberto covers his body with a sheet.] Anything for you, buddy.
	Roberto	Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise.
	Bender	Uh, what's with the get-up?
	Roberto	I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill you so you don't squeal?
	Bender	I'm in! I'm in! [He laughs nervously.] So when were you planning the breakout?
	Roberto	I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
	Bender	Quick! Let's keep escaping!
	Hermes	Times two, carry the one...
	Fry	Oh, you sad, worthless human.
	Hermes	What are ya-- Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!
	Fry	Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
	Hermes	Robots don't say "ye"!
	Fry	Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs. [He looks at the paperwork.] What is the meaning of this symbol?
	Hermes	That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!
	Fry	I'll show ye!
	Fry	Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
	Leela	You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
	Fry	Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet.
	Leela	OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
	Professor Farnsworth	You're going to do his laundry?
	Leela	[sexfully] Fry, this is for you.
	Fry	Beep.
	Leela	Oh, for God's sake!
	Zoidberg	By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?
	Fry	[drunk] Alcohol fuels my power cells. [He stands up.] And as a mighty robot, I-- [He burps and falls back onto the couch, tipping it over backwards.] Beep.
	Roberto	Thanks for helping me escape, Bender.
	Bender	Oh, it was nothing.
	Roberto	[shouting] It was not nothing! [talking] I wanna repay you. Let me get you something in here.
	Roberto	[shouting] Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
	Bender	Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto.
	Roberto	Gimme the remaining dough. And the calendars ... and that pen. Try to tear it so most of the beads are on my end!
	URL	Police! You're busted!
	Smitty	And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof. [Roberto puts his arm through the glass and waves his knife around.] Fire lasers! [They do and the laser bolts bounce off the glass.] Duck! Lasers!
	Bender	Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
	Amy	Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel.
	Bender	[panting] Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto.
	Hermes	Hey, mon.
	Roberto	Nice to meet you.
	Smitty	[on megaphone; from outside] Come out with your hands up.
	Roberto	[shouting] Hostages!
	Roberto	Back off! I got hostages!
	Zoidberg	Hooray! I'm helping!
	Smitty	[on megaphone] Do you have any better hostages?
	Roberto	To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna execute some of you. How 'bout you?
	Professor Farnsworth	Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
	Leela	Wait! Take me first!
	Bender	Yes! Take her first.
	Roberto	Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!
	Zoidberg	Oh, the fear!
	Roberto	I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first. Go!
	Bender	Um ... OK. Fifty ... six ... ish?
	Roberto	56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you ... no good ... 56-ing--
	Bender	Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm Syndrome ... handsome!
	Fry	Halt, fellow robot!
	Roberto	Hey, Red. You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side you wanna be on?
	Fry	The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!
	Leela	Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
	Fry	Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is: I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots.
	Roberto	I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly!
	Hermes	Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!
	Roberto	Let's see how much of a robot you really are!
	Fry	No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
	Roberto	Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody help me! Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled the transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! Don't weld me to the wall, Mommy!
	Smitty	[on megaphone] We're willing to listen to your demands.
	URL	Hey, baby. Wash that off before you put it back.
	Hermes	Who's brave now?
	Amy	Hooray!
	Zoidberg	Bravo!
	Leela	You did it, Fry.
	Bender	Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race.
	Fry	[mechanical voice] It was nothing. I-- [He sees his bleeding arm and screams. His wipes some onto his finger and looks at it.] [normal] Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--
	Zoidberg	A squid?
	Fry	A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!
	Zoidberg	Also good.
	Leela	Thanks for saving us, Fry.
	Fry	I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
	Bender	Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot.
	Fry	Aw. Thanks, Bender.
	Bender	Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human. [He takes one out and everyone gasps and cringes.] What?
	Bender	[over credits] What?
