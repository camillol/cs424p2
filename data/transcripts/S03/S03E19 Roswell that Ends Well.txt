	Fry	I've never seen a supernova blow up, but if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!
	Bender	Yeah! Anyone who misses this will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Fry, could you go make some popcorn?
	Fry	OK.
	Fry	Let's go, microwave, I'm in a hurry here! [He opens the door and hesitates before he puts it in.] Hm? [He reads the "Warning: Do Not Put In Microwave" label, tears it off and chuckles. He puts the packet in the microwave and presses the button. The popcorn fizzles and blue light leaks out of the microwave and begins to engulf the room.] Hey, what smells like blue?
	Leela	[shouting] Fry, get up here! It's starting!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Focus!
	Bender	Oh, boy!
	Leela	Oh!
	Fry	Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?
	Zoidberg	My head is spinning.
	Fry	Ooh! My popcorn's done!
	Fry	Aw! It's less popped than ever.
	Leela	I don't know what happened, but we've taken on a lot of clocks. [She indicates the clocks on the floor.] Let's get back home.
	Leela	Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
	Prof. Farnsworth	And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
	Zoidberg	Such noises!
	Leela	Oh, no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing.
	Fry	We're gonna crash!
	Leela	Not if I can help it! [The engines cut out.] Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone, put on your seatbelts.
	Bender	Ah, those things cost more lives than they save.
	Fry	Bender, are you OK?
	Bender	I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
	Leela	Alright, here's the plan: Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five.
	Zoidberg	And Zoidberg picks up another piece. The crowd goes wild! [He mimes a cheering crowd. Car headlights shine in his eyes and he shields them.] What is?
	Man	General, in all my years of covering top secret discoveries with sheets, I've never dramatically revealed anything as shocking as this. Dun-dun-dun! The debris from an alien spaceship.
	General	Son, I think I can safely say--
	Man	As you can see, 1947 is going to be an eventful year for the town of ... Roswell, New Mexico.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Remarkable! According the high-precision digital chronograph it's July 9th, 1947, which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.
	Bender	Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave--
	Fry	Yo!
	Prof. Farnsworth	And the microwave radiation, combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova, blasted us through time itself.
	Leela	Have you seen today's news?
	Bender	High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
	Leela	No, over here! [She points at the headline.] [reading] Flying saucer captured!
	Bender	That's no flying saucer! That's my ass!
	Fry	My God! This means the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell ... was us!
	Prof. Farnsworth	And the alien they captured was ... was...
	Zoidberg	Hello! [The general winces.] So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope to get back to our own time is to go through it in, oh, say ... [He looks at his watch.] ... exactly 24 hours.
	Leela	No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I should have that operational within 10 hours.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You've got eight! But a more urgent concern is the microwave. [He picks up the charred microwave.] Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
	Leela	Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave somewhere around here. [She turns to Fry.] Meanwhile, you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body.
	Fry	Hey, and while we're on the base, I'll visit my grandfather, Enos. He was stationed at Roswell.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Your grandfather? [He leaps up.] Stay away from him, you dim-witted monkey. You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!
	Fry	Got it.
	Prof. Farnsworth	If, for example, you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist.
	Fry	But existing is basically all I do!
	General	What is your purpose here?
	Zoidberg	[drowsy] Alright, Officer, I'll move along.
	Man	What the general means is why did you come to Earth?
	Zoidberg	Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
	Sergeant	[shouting] Enos! [Fry gasps and takes Bender's eyes off his head and uses them to zoom in. He sees Enos and a sergeant yelling at him.] Private, I want that toilet bowl so clean I could eat off it! 'Cause I intend to!
	Enos	Well gadzooks, Sarge!
	Fry	It's him! It's my grandfather, Enos.
	Sergeant	[shouting] Now prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at twelve-hundred hours!
	Fry	That Jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore! [Screaming, he runs and pushes Enos out of the way of the slow-moving Jeep, which turns right before it gets to them.] Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
	Enos	I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!
	Bender	Pst! Fry! Stop interfering with history. I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back.
	Fry	[whispering] I had no choice; I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear.
	Enos	Well, thanks, soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken, best part of the job! [He licks his fingers.] Mmm! Finger-licking good!
	Fry	That's it! This place is too dangerous. We gotta get you out of here! [He stoops to Enos's crotch.] [shouting] Everything's gonna be alright, Dad!
	Enos	Well gadzooks! I'd better ask Sarge.
	Fry	[shouting] No time! Run! Run to safety!
	Man	This experiment will determine what food, if any, the alien eats.
	Zoidberg	A buffet! Oh, if only I had my wallet with me!
	Man	Um, it's free.
	General	Get me the President.
	Leela	Fry's from around this time. I'll talk like him. [She approaches a salesman.] Yo, homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.
	Salesman	Microwave? Never heard of that brand, sweetheart. What you want is the "Deluxe Gas Princess". [He indicates an oven.] This beauty has four broilers, a casserole indicator, a fold-out ironing board and, down here, a foot-soaking tub. Since, as a woman, you'll be standing in front of it all day.
	Leela	Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll aks you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?
	Salesman	Sir, your wife's hysterical, so I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning fast. It takes only five hours to cook a roast.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ooh, that's good news! You know, you really don't cook enough roasts, Leela. [Leela turns the gas hob on and sets fire to Farnsworth's tie. He turns to the salesman.] Women!
	Fry	Thank God I got you off that dangerous army base.
	Enos	You sure are the helpful type, stranger. Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox? [He reaches into Bender's head and takes out some microchips.] Ooh! Snacks!
	Bender	Hey! That's my brain!
	Enos	Damn! Them crackers cut my mouth up somethin' bad! Let's stop off for a malt.
	Enos	See that waitress there?
	Fry	Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
	Enos	That's my fianc√©e, Mildred.
	Fry	Grandma Mildred? Uh, no dessert! Just coffee.
	Mildred	Okie-doke. And for you, Snuggums?
	Enos	Uh, I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top.
	Fry	She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away.
	Enos	Yeah, folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls 'cause you're supposed to?
	Fry	What? Don't ever, ever say or think that again! Please! Just concentrate on staying alive. [A flame in the kitchen flares and Fry gasps.] Fire! Look out! [He leans forward and knocks the table over. The cutlery slides off and a knife lands inches from Enos's crotch.] Oh! You almost got neutered.
	Enos	Well it ain't as bad as getting killed.
	Fry	For me it is! [He stands up.] I'm getting you outta here!
	Enos	Ow!
	Fry	OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.
	Fry	Safe and sound! Finally, I can continue to exist.
	Man #2	Three, two, one.
	Bender	And you are outta here!
	Mildred	What'll you folks have today?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw.
	Mildred	Pardon?
	Leela	[whispering] It's the 20th century, Professor.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, right! I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead.
	Leela	I'll just have a small injection of Femislim.
	Mildred	Uh, two chilli dogs comin' up.
	Leela	Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper and then the terrible tragedy of his death.
	Leela	Wait a second! There's a microwave radar dish at the army base. We could steal it!
	Prof. Farnsworth	No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was.
	Fry	Well, I killed my grandfather.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wha?
	Leela	Wait. If you killed your grandfather, why do you still exist?
	Fry	I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
	Mildred	Killed? In an atomic blast? [crying] No, sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly.
	Fry	Aw. There, there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vaporised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie.
	Mildred	[crying] I'm not worried about that.
	Fry	Then you're a braver woman than I.
	Mildred	You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?
	Fry	Uh, how far is it?
	General	Welcome to Roswell, President Truman.
	Truman	Fellas, this visit's top secret. No one's to know about it except the senior officers ... [They salute.] ... scientists ... [They nod.] ... and a single conspiracy nutter no one will believe.
	General	Mr. President, our men have assembled the parts from the alien ship into its original design.
	Truman	Whistling Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
	General	But, sir, that's where we're building the fake moon landing set.
	Truman	Then we'll have to really land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fannies!
	Truman	If you come in peace, surrender or be destroyed. If you're here to make war, we surrender.
	Zoidberg	Both good. The important thing is I'm meeting new people.
	Truman	Bushwah! Now what's your mission? Are you planning to make some kind of alien-human hybrid?
	Zoidberg	Are you coming onto me?
	Truman	Hot crackers! I take exception to that!
	Zoidberg	[sexfully] I'm not hearing a no.
	Truman	Nerks to this space crab! If we want information, we'll have to do us an old-fashioned alien autopsy!
	Zoidberg	Hooray!
	Mildred	[crying] Every little thing reminds me of Enos.
	Fry	Aw, I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.
	Mildred	It's all so sad. At times like this, I just need someone to hold me. [She puts her arms around Fry.] Mmm. [sexfully] You like holding me, don't you?
	Fry	Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!
	Mildred	How 'bout these cookies, sugar?
	Fry	I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do exist. Which proves ... you can't really be my grandm--
	Bender	[from outside] Oh, my God!
	Prof. Farnsworth	What the hell have you done, Fry?
	Fry	Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope! Look!
	Mildred	Come back to bed, deary.
	Fry	It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Isn't it obvious? [Fry shakes his head.] You are!
	Mildred	Did you say something, deary? I'm a bit hard of hearing.
	Pathologist #1	Commencing excavation of the subject's chest cavity.
	Zoidberg	And in this corner, Zoidberg! [He laughs.] C'mon! Lighten up! What is this, a funeral?
	Pathologist #2	Heart.
	Zoidberg	Take, I've got four of them.
	Pathologist #1	Stomach contents: One deviled egg.
	Zoidberg	Deviled egg?
	Pathologist #1	The same deviled egg.
	Leela	Snap out of it!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Start the ship, Leela. Let's just steal the damn radar dish and get back to our own time.
	Fry	But-- But won't that change history?
	Prof. Farnsworth	[sarcastic] Oh, a lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!
	Conspiracy Nutter	UFO! UFO!
	Zoidberg	Hey, don't cut that! I need that to speak!
	Pathologist #2	Oh, my!
	Truman	Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!
	Leela	Hi-yah! [She kicks the other pathologist.] Yah! [Truman peers over the edge of the table and she kicks him.] Yah!
	Fry	Take this, Mr. President-- Sir!
	Zoidberg	The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Huh, wha? Oh, right!
	Sergeant	[shouting] Enos!
	Fry	[shouting; from ship] He's dead! Sorry!
	Fry	Yay!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Choke on that, causality!
	Bender	[shouting] 1947 can kiss my shiny metal--
	Fry	Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Impossible! The supernova time hole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century.
	Fry	[shouting; from ship] Bender!
	Zoidberg	There! Good as new!
	Leela	Don't you need this one?
	Zoidberg	Oh, no! That's my-- [He gags, chokes and keels over. He gets back up again, smiling.] Gotcha!
	Fry	Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now, trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!
	Leela	Anything?
	Fry	No. [The metal detector beeps.] Wait!
	Bender	Ow! Stupid junk!
	Fry	He's alive! [Leela and Farnsworth cheer. Leela digs and pulls Bender's head from the ground.] Bender, what was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?
	Bender	I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather then who are we to judge?
	Bender	Amen!
