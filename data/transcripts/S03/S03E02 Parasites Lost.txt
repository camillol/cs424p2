	Man #1	[on radio] Breaker-breaker, this here's the Duck. Uh, you wanna back off them hogs?
	Man #1	[on radio] Ten-four, five miles or so.
	Man #2	[on radio] Ten, roger!
	Leela	Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. [She pulls the dipstick out of the ship and looks at it.] [shouting] We're OK on Coke syrup.
	Bender	Oh, man! Come on! [Leela pushes the dipstick back in. Bender suddenly explodes and his head flies past.] Comin' through!
	Bender	What's that black cracker?
	Fry	A tomato.
	Leela	You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
	Fry	Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen? [He takes a bite out of the sandwich.] Ugh! It's like a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!
	Trucker	Lookie there! It's one of them things like on our mud flaps!
	Hoschel	Yosemite Sam?
	Sal	Stands back! I'm gonna puts my moves on her. [He wiggles his hips at Leela and hoots.] Whoas!
	Fry	That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!
	Leela	Fry, please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass-whooping!
	Sal	Hey, sexy mama, let's get busy and freaky in that order!
	Fry	Hey, jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?
	Sal	Eh, I gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck stop chick!
	Fry	You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
	Sal	Yeah, you're right. She don't gots enough meat for a guy like me.
	Fry	She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow! [Leela hovers down and pulls Fry away by the hair.] Ow!
	Sal	[laughing] More meat than a cow!
	Fry	I can't please Leela no matter what I do. I just want her to like me.
	Bender	Well there's always hope. [He pats him on the back and laughs.] C'mon, we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
	Bender	Who are you?
	Scruffy	Scruffy. The janitor.
	Bender	Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
	Scruffy	Schedule conflict.
	Bender	There! Fixed forever.
	Scruffy	Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived. [He continues looking at the magazine. The boiler explodes. Fry and Bender scream.] Oh, marmalade!
	Zoidberg	Oh, the hypochondriac's back! So what is it this time?
	Fry	Well, my lead pipe hurts a little.
	Zoidberg	That's normal. Next patient.
	Bender	He's a witch!
	Professor Farnsworth	Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?
	Fry	No.
	Leela	What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
	Fry	I've had better.
	Professor Farnsworth	Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come, everyone. Give Fry some privacy.
	Professor Farnsworth	If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen.
	Zoidberg	Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. [He holds up an endoscope. Fry opens his mouth.] Guess again.
	Amy	Gross!
	Bender	[leaning over her shoulder] Go, man! Go!
	Professor Farnsworth	Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
	Amy	It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
	Bender	Oh! Ew!
	Amy	Worms? Ew! Puke-a-tronic!
	Leela	So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were--
	Professor Farnsworth	Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonnaise was probably none too fresh either.
	Hermes	It's nauseating, mon! [He chomps a handful of popcorn.] Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?
	Professor Farnsworth	Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!
	Bender	Shotgun!
	Zoidberg	[almost simultaneous] Shotgun!
	Professor Farnsworth	In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria -- a harpoon!
	Bender	Yo, old guy, why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, my, no. That would require extremely tiny atoms, and have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money! Leave me alone!
	Zoidberg	Me next!
	Farnsworth-Droid	Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
	Zoidberg-Droid	There's no part of that sentence I didn't like.
	Farnsworth-Droid	Is everyone present?
	Amy-Droid	Right on!
	Bender-Droid	Uh-huh.
	Hermes-Droid	Definitely.
	Zoidberg-Droid	Yes.
	Farnsworth-Droid	Here's the plan: [He turns on a holographic version of Fry's body in the middle of the table.] We'll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the pelvic splanchnic ganglion and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling, among other things, the parasites.
	Bender-Droid	I'll tell Fry to wash out, among other things, his ear.
	Farnsworth-Droid	No! Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows.
	Bender-Droid	They know how to make ice cream soup?
	Farnsworth-Droid	Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to.
	Leela	[echoing] Can do!
	Amy-Droid	Leela, you should really try a facial scrub, for your pores.
	Leela	Look! A starling!
	Fry	[looking away] Really?
	Farnsworth-Droid	[whispering] Sh! Be very quiet. We're in the ear.
	Amy-Droid	[whispering] OK, Professor.
	Farnsworth-Droid	[shouting] What?
	Fry	What about what?
	Leela	Uh ... what if we go for a walk, possibly, because it's such a lovely day, perhaps.
	Fry	I'd love to!
	Hermes-Droid	We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!
	Bender-Droid	It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
	Farnsworth-Droid	Wait! We just have to get past the eardrum.
	Hermes-Droid	[from ship] What are those worms doing to Fry's brain?
	Farnsworth-Droid	[from ship] They're giving it a complete tune-up. A cursory glance would suggest they've doubled his thinking power.
	Hermes-Droid	[from ship] My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher!
	Fry	Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions. [He hold the flowers out to Leela.] For you.
	Leela	That's such a beautiful thought, Fry. And what's more amazing, you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me.
	Farnsworth-Droid	Brace yourselves, everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose.
	Bender-Droid	We're at finger alert five.
	Farnsworth-Droid	Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors. [whispering] Nobody make a smell.
	Zoidberg-Droid	Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus.
	Hermes-Droid	Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy.
	Zoidberg-Droid	I learned it from a decongestant commercial. [echoing] "Soothing action, action, action, action..."
	Bender-Droid	Where are we? The ass?
	Farnsworth-Droid	We're in the heart. Better known as "The Love Muscle".
	Zoidberg-Droid	Where the food is digested.
	Farnsworth-Droid	We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster.
	Bender-Droid	Abandon ship!
	Farnsworth-Droid	No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
	Zoidberg-Droid	It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!
	Amy-Droid	[from ship] Look! They're jazz-ercising Fry's muscles!
	Hermes-Droid	He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumby and Hercules combined!
	Zoidberg-Droid	Gumbercules? I love that guy!
	Leela	It's that jerk from the truck stop! [Sal leans against a barrier munching a sandwich.] Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
	Fry	I don't think so. [He marches up to Sal.] Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology.
	Leela	Fry, no! He's bulging with what could be muscles. [Fry tears off his shirt Ã  la Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons revealing what definitely are muscles.] Ooh!
	Sal	I gots your apologys right heres! [He whips out a knife. Fry grabs his arm and slams him down on the pavement and kicks him in front of Leela. Sal lies flat on his back and groans.] Sorrys, ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson about not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets.
	Farnsworth-Droid	[from ship] Ah, the stomach: Scenic gateway to the bowel.
	Bender-Droid	Abandon ship!
	Farnsworth-Droid	No! Don't give up now! We're but a stone's throw from the pyloric sphincter.
	Bender-Droid	[from ship] Hooray!
	Zoidberg-Droid	[from ship] Hooray!
	Hermes-Droid	[from ship] We made it!
	Farnsworth-Droid	There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily-guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splanchnic ganglion.
	Zoidberg-Droid	I've heard of that! Who said I haven't?
	Farnsworth-Droid	If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society.
	Hermes-Droid	But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?
	Farnsworth-Droid	Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!
	Bender-Droid	Alright, let's mush some worms!
	Worm Mayor	Worms to battle stations!
	Leela	I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I aks you something?
	Fry	Anything.
	Leela	Why did you do all that stuff?
	Fry	Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not.
	Leela	What is it? Is it about Bender?
	Fry	No, it's about you and me.
	Leela	And Bender?
	Fry	Bender's not involved. [He reaches out and holds Leela's hands.] Leela ... I love you.
	Leela	You do?
	Fry	Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have.
	Leela	Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?
	Fry	Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day.
	Leela	Stay here.
	Waitress	Freshen your noc-a-tina?
	Fry	Please. [She pours.] I need something to settle my stomach.
	Farnsworth-Droid	The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?
	Zoidberg-Droid	Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!
	Bender-Droid	[from outside] One! Two! Three!
	Farnsworth-Droid	There it is! The pelvic splanchnic ganglion. [They walk towards it.] Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!
	Leela-Droid	Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!
	Farnsworth-Droid	Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!
	Hermes-Droid	I call it "Caribbean Drain-o"!
	Farnsworth-Droid	Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.
	Leela-Droid	Perfect.
	Zoidberg-Droid	Ouch!
	Amy	I'm OK.
	Professor Farnsworth	Leela, you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
	Leela	So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, that's stupid!
	Fry	If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge.
	Fry	Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the-- Hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?
	Leela	[sexfully] I'll think of something.
	Bender	'Ello! What's all this then?
	Fry	Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
	Leela	[opening the door] I should warn you, it's a little under-furnished.
	Leela	I'm thinking of having a window installed.
	Fry	I think the view's perfect already!
	Leela	Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom.
	Fry	Wait. In a minute.
	Leela	A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that, and they're not very good at it.
	Fry	They don't have you to inspire them.
	Leela	I don't have words to say how wonderful you are, Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.
	Fry	When I'm with you, every day seems like double-soup Tuesday.
	Leela	Oh, Fry! I love what you've become.
	Fry	What I've become.
	Leela	What is it?
	Fry	There's just something I have to find out.
	Fry-Droid	Who controls this bowel?
	Worm Guard #1	Who wants to know?
	Worm Mayor	I am the Lord Mayor of Cologne.
	Fry-Droid	You mean "colon"?
	Worm Mayor	State your business!
	Fry-Droid	Your Excellency, have you ever been in love?
	Worm Mayor	No. I thought I was once but then I remember our species reproduces with a cloud of spores.
	Fry-Droid	Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why, with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave.
	Worm Mayor	Listen, you: I was born here, I raised a cloud of children here, my ancestors came over here on the sandwich. [He draws his sword.] No one can make me leave.
	Fry-Droid	Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!
	Worm Mayor	He's bluffing! No creature would willingly make an idiot out of itself.
	Fry-Droid	Obviously you've never been in love! [He cuts through the nerve and the worms fall to the floor. Fry swings on the cut nerve and lands on a catwalk. He runs along it, slashing nerves as he goes.] Ow! Ow! Ow! [The worms look up and gasp. Fry stands next to a lobe at the end of the catwalk.] Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe.
	Worm Guard #1	Stop it, man!
	Worm Mayor	You've damaged your brain, Universe, but no more than a week of binge drinking or five minutes on a cell phone.
	Fry-Droid	I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata, control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me.
	Worm Guard #2	Wait a minute, man!
	Fry-Droid	I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!
	Worm Mayor	Stop! We'll leave. [He puts his sword away.] But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger and boom! You'll be crawling with us again. Ever wonder what makes special sauce so special? Yo!
	Leela	Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
	Fry	I'm about to. [He holds up his holophonor.] Leela, let me play for you one for time.
	Leela	You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
	Fry	Please, it's important to me.
	Leela	What's that supposed to mean?
	Fry	I don't know. I got nervous and I started thinking about neck bolts. [He reaches around to hug Leela but he knocks the vase of Leela's flowers off the table with his holophonor. The vase breaks.] Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like--
	Leela	What's happened to you?
	Fry	Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
	Leela	What? Why would you do that?
	Fry	Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them.
	Leela	Well ... which of you wrote me that sonnet?
	Fry	I did ... I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!
	Leela	I don't know.
	Fry	Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed-- Uh-oh!
	Bender	Sorry you struck out, sausage link.
	Bender	If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!
	Fry	Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.
	Bender	There you go! [He yawns.] Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
