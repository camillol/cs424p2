	Mr. Wong	[from inside] Yes?
	Amy	Hi, Dad. It's me and my co-workers.
	Mrs. Wong	[from inside] Open up, Leo. It's Amy and her weirdos.
	Mrs. Wong	Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!
	Leela	Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue.
	Mr. Wong	Oh, Mars Day much better than Earth Day. Dump trash wherever you want! Big, empty planet!
	Mrs. Wong	OK, then. Make yourselves at home.
	Zoidberg	Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway.
	Prof. Farnsworth	This is quite a large ranch you have.
	Mr. Wong	17.9 billion acres. We own entire western hemisphere. [whispering] That the best hemisphere!
	Prof. Farnsworth	It's the same on Earth.
	Mr. Wong	Here is most number one product of all: The mighty buggalo. They used for everything; meat, milk and their shells make good row boat.
	Zoidberg	[shouting] I broke your television.
	Hermes	Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle.
	Mr. Wong	Not really. We own so much stuff it easier just to brand everything that not ours.
	Hermes	Please don't do that.
	Amy	Betsy! [It licks Amy. The rest of the staff gather around.] This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters.
	Mr. Wong	Yes, everybody love Betsy. We going to eat her at Amy's wedding. If she ever get married!
	Amy	Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight.
	Mr. Wong	Oh, that right. We finally get to spend some time with this Mr. Kif.
	Mrs. Wong	I just hope he's a nice man who can make us lot of grandchildren. This not some parallel universe where you getting any younger.
	Zapp	Now remember, Kif, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them and you're in.
	Kif	Actually, sir, I'm-I'm a little nervous about meeting her family.
	Zapp	Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite.
	Kif	I just hope they like me.
	Zapp	And why wouldn't they? Yes, yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your tedious life story, Kif. And above all have fun!
	Bender	Yeah, yeah, get on down! [He scratches again.] Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!
	DJ	Yo, fool, it's Mixmaster Festus!
	Fry	So what's Mars Day about, anyway?
	Mrs. Wong	It commemorate the day centuries ago when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong, bought Mars from stupid natives.
	Leela	How can you call the Native Martians "stupid"?
	Mr. Wong	They sell whole planet for one bead. Sound stupid to me!
	Prof. Farnsworth	That is stupid!
	Leela	I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people.
	Fry	Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!
	Leela	Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
	Kif	Amy, no! Not on your parents' planet!
	RJ	Howdy, Amy. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where the flavour is.
	Amy	RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif.
	RJ	This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby. [He takes out a cigarette box.] Cigarette, partner?
	Kif	Oh, I don't--
	RJ	I haven't even lit it yet!
	Kif	Oh. Is it lit now?
	RJ	Yep. [Kif coughs and spits the cigarette out. RJ catches it and smokes it.] You're pathetic!
	Zoidberg	Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
	Mr. Wong	You here five hours and already you tear up couch, draw moustache on priceless painting and fill pool with brine shrimp.
	Zoidberg	[nudging Mrs. Wong] Not bad for a city boy, huh? [Mr. Wong takes a bite of caviar.] By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar.
	Amy	Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you.
	Kif	You don't understand. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex. [He turns transparent.] Oh, dear! [He paces.] Oh, goodness! Oh, odds and bodkins!
	Fry	I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
	Mr. Wong	You want some salad with that?
	Fry	Yuck!
	Amy	Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?
	Mr. Wong	This your boyfriend? I have instant dislike of him!
	Mrs. Wong	He too scrawny to father grandchildren.
	Amy	He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned.
	Kif	Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--
	Mr. Wong	Yes, yes! You a big squishy wuss! Amy should be dating real man. Like him!
	Kif	I can be manly too. I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke.
	Amy	[whispering] Wrong way!
	Kif	[wheezy] Smooth!
	Amy	Look on the bright side: My parents left after you passed out so they didn't even see you barf.
	Kif	Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter.
	Amy	It's OK, Kif. [Kif whimpers.] I'll go get you a tissue from your tote.
	RJ	Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe.
	Joe	Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club!
	RJ	Kids love him!
	Fry	What's that weird sound?
	Mr. Wong	Dust storm! Oh, dust storm! Everybody into house. Hurry, before we die. And wipe your damn feet!
	Mrs. Wong	Phew! Everyone OK? No one considering lawsuit?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hmm. I might have mental anguish.
	Mr. Wong	I'll have you know I'm friends with every judge on planet.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm OK then.
	Mrs. Wong	Storm dying down. Leo, check if buggalo herd is OK.
	Mr. Wong	Oh!
	Leela	What happened to the buggalo?
	Mr. Wong	They been rustled under cover of storm. We ruined!
	Zoidberg	[screaming] Nooo!
	Amy	Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK.
	Mr. Wong	Oh, really? Who gonna save us? [He points at Leela.] One-eye? [He points at Zoidberg.] Lobster mooch? [He points at Bender.] Drunken garbage can?
	Hermes	This sounds like a job for--
	Kif	Lieutenant Kif Kroker!
	Hermes	Alright then.
	Mr. Wong	Aye-ah! Those buggalo are what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, with them stolen, we ruined!
	Mrs. Wong	OK. I want a divorce.
	Zoidberg	Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
	Amy	They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart.
	Zoidberg	Aw!
	Amy	Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers.
	Kif	Mrs. Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?
	Kif	My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough, tough cattle drive. Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!
	Prof. Farnsworth	It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him.
	Fry	Aw, man!
	Kif	Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back or die trying.
	Mr. Wong	Hey, we can't lose!
	Amy	No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness.
	Mrs. Wong	Oh, yes he does!
	RJ	Here are your mounts!
	Leela	She's got a fine coat.
	Kif	Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?
	Amy	You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit. [Betsy leaps onto Kif.] Aw, she likes you!
	Kif	Saddle up, men. We got some no good rustlers to ... catch!
	Bender	[singing]Â : We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers,Somebody wants to pick a fight with us,He'd better bite my ass!
	Fry	Yee-haw!
	Leela	Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system.
	Fry	Where?
	Leela	Right in front of you.
	Fry	Oh. Oh!
	Kif	We'll camp near the top. The rustlers will be sure to spot us there.
	Fry	Where?
	Bender	And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!
	Fry	Pft, that's not scary!
	Bender	It is if you're a laser printer.
	Leela	OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--
	Fry	Hook on the hand!
	Kif	OK, I've got one. This family--
	Fry	Man in the attic!
	Leela	Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!
	Fry	With pleasure. [spookily] Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--
	Bender	[speaking fast] Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! [normal] Sorry, go on.
	Fry	And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--
	Amy	[from bushes] Surprise!
	Kif	Amy? What are you doing here?
	Amy	I forgot to give you something before you left.
	Kif	What?
	Amy	Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?
	Kif	I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit! A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings.
	Amy	But you still have them, right?
	Kif	Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary.
	Amy	Ah, it's a wonderful night.
	Kif	It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night.
	Amy	I can't! [She kisses him and the ground shakes.] What's that?
	Kif	Maybe we just made love.
	Amy	The buggalo! They're in the crater.
	Kif	The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared.
	Amy	Oh, Kif! You're so brave!
	Kif	[nervous] Sh! They'll hear us!
	Kif	OK, the dynamite's in place.
	Amy	Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
	Leela	Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
	Amy	Well, actually--
	Bender	Too late! This is more fun!
	Amy	Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?
	Kif	I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially the same.
	Fry	Hey, it's that "barbecue's over" sound again.
	Leela	[shouting] Sandstorm! [The tornado picks up the buggalo and them. They tumble around inside the tornado and then fall to the ground.] We're in the eye of the storm!
	Fry	Where?
	Bender	What's that?
	Fry	My God!
	Leela	Who are they?
	Singing Wind	Fehk! We are the Native Martians.
	Fry	Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.
	Singing Wind	Only those who revere Mother Mars can fly buggalo. And only they shall have buggalo. And they're us.
	Kif	But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family.
	Singing Wind	You mean family that took all Martian land and gave us one lousy bead?
	Amy	Uh-huh! Amy Wong. [She holds out her hand.] And you are?
	Singing Wind	Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo. But now we take girl instead.
	Amy	Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
	Kif	Amy! Nooo!
	Bender	Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you.
	Mr. Wong	Hooray! You bring back cattle.
	Kif	Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well.
	Mrs. Wong	Let Amy tell us. That way it soften the blow. [There is silence.] Why Amy being so quiet?
	Kif	Um ... well, um ... that is, um...
	Mr. Wong	Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy! [Inside it says "We Take Daughter. Us Want Land" and there is a picture of Amy blindfolded, holding today's newspaper.] I know it them 'cause they no use good grammar.
	Kif	I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear.
	Mr. Wong	Forget it, squishy. You the one lose her in first place. You done enough.
	Mrs. Wong	Yeah. This time we get most decorated law man in the whole universe!
	Kif	You mean-- Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--
	Zapp	I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!
	Mrs. Wong	Please, Mr. Brannigan, we need you go get our daughter back.
	Zapp	Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally. [The Wongs gasp.] Your gasps intrigue me. Explain.
	Mr. Wong	Martians have no land. They been gently encouraged to live on reservation deep underground. No one ever dare go there.
	Prof. Farnsworth	This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--
	Bender	Damn you, old man!
	Leela	Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!
	Zapp	I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!
	Kif	She won't leave me alone.
	Zapp	Did I say "girlfriend"? She sounds more like a wife!
	Zapp	Behold: The Great Stone Face of Mars.
	Fry	Hm.
	Zapp	The only known entrance to the Martian reservation.
	Leela	What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
	Zapp	Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet.
	Zapp	Nose-ward, ho!
	Singing Wind	Fehk! I am Singing Wind, chief of the Martian tribe.
	Zapp	Take me to your leader.
	Singing Wind	Moving along. Why you trespass on our land?
	Zapp	We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify: Land is the stuff that has sky over it.
	Leela	They have such respect for the planet.
	Martian #1	Cynthia used to drink Slurm.
	Singing Wind	We will give back girl when we get back planet surface.
	Zapp	How do we even know she's alive?
	Amy	I'm fine.
	Zapp	Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?
	Singing Wind	You waste words. We want return of land that was taken from us.
	Bender	Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.
	Singing Wind	Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land back!
	Zapp	Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ... [He pulls out a gun.] ... no backsies!
	Singing Wind	The time for stupid statements is over!
	Zapp	Oh, boy!
	Leela	Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!
	Zoidberg	[from inside] Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
	Kif	Amy, no! It's too windy! [Betsy nudges him and Kif smiles. Amy screams as the tornado lifts her higher.] Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!
	Amy	Kif! [She gasps.] You're flying Betsy!
	Kif	Need a lift?
	Singing Wind	Great Mother Mars! He has the gift!
	Leela	Yay, Kif!
	Zapp	Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!
	Singing Wind	We have misjudged you, green one. You fly the buggalo like us. You have true reverence for Mother Mars. Let there be peace between us.
	Martian #2	Yes. Let us smoke-em peace pipe.
	Kif	Smoke-em?
	Singing Wind	Here, take.
	Kif	Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch.
	Singing Wind	You must smoke peace pipe, and you must do it peacefully. Or we'll kill you.
	Kif	Well, it's just really that I don't feel that--
	Zapp	Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on-the-ball.
	Fry	Yeah!
	Zapp	Yes, sir!
	Bender	Way to suck it!
	Kif	Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest! [He takes another puff. Singing Wind pats him on the back. Kif coughs and splutters and the Martians gasp.] Oh, monkey trumpets!
	Singing Wind	You have coughed at our offer of peace. So you must die!
	Martian #3	The very bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones.
	Kif	Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--
	Fry	Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
	Leela	It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
	Singing Wind	Really?
	Bender	Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!
	Amy	Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it.
	Singing Wind	Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership.
	Bender	So we can have the diamond?
	Singing Wind	No. We do have concept of ownership. You are free to go. Sorry about all the rustling and kidnapping.
	Leela	But what about your sacred land?
	Singing Wind	Land shmand! We don't wanna live on this planet. It's a dump. We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. With cash like this, who's going to argue? Nobody, that's who!
	Amy	Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians.
	Mr. Wong	Please! He too much of a wimp.
	Mrs. Wong	Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.
	Zapp	Please, you give me too little credit.
	Zoidberg	Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!
	Zoidberg	Money doesn't make good people, no, siree!
	Amy	Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero.
	Kif	Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me.
	Amy	Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls?
	Kif	[writing] Dear diary, I just made love for the second time!
