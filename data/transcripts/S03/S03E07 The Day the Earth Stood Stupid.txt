	Amy	Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?
	Leela	He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through. [She puts Nibbler down and takes a whole joint out of the bag.] Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham. [Nibbler doesn't move.] Roll over. Roll over for the ham. [Nibbler chirps and licks his leg and arm.] You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?
	Professor Farnsworth	Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
	Bender	"$500", you say?
	Zoidberg	"Dog food", you say?
	Fry	Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep ... [He yawns.] ... three sheep.
	Leela	The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad. [The Hypno-Toad is a toad, almost the size of the sheep. It stares at them and it's eyes oscillate and buzz. The sheep walk in single file into the pen and one closes the gate behind it. The judges confer and the Hypno-Toad turns around and hypnotises them. They stare at it, open-mouthed and raise "10" cards. The crowd cheers. Leela stands at the side of the ring and puts Nibbler into it.] Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!
	Amy	Come on, Nibbler!
	Bender	[to judge] Ma'am, I have a late entry: My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.
	Bender	Faster! Faster.
	Zoidberg	Ow!
	Bender	Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
	Bender	Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!
	Bender	I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
	Fry	I love these things!
	Leela	Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. [He doesn't.] He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!
	Judge #1	Third prize, a party-sized keg of guinea pigs, goes to Dave Spiegel and his owner, Fluffers. [A human-sized cat strokes a cat-sized man. The crowd cheers and Fluffers stands on the podium.] Second prize, this lovely afghan made from an Afghan, goes to Bender and his wooping terrier.
	Bender	Second place? [He pulls Zoidberg's choke chain.] That's a fancy word for losing. [He whips Zoidberg as he speaks.] You didn't stick your landing!
	Zoidberg	Forgive me, my friend.
	Bender	Never!
	Judge #1	And before we announce the winner we have a special award for a first-time contestant: Ms. Leela and her mystery pet, Nibbler!
	Leela	Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
	Judge #1	That's just the kind of eloquence you'd expect from the owner of Dumbest Pet in Show. [He puts a conical hat on Nibbler with "Dumb" written down the middle of it. Everyone laughs.] And the grand prize winner ... [He looks at his notes and adjusts his glasses.] [monotonous] ... the Hypno-Toad. [The Hypno-Toad sits on the podium hypnotising the judge. The Hypno-Toad turns to the crowd and they clap in unison.] All glory to the Hypno-Toad.
	Leela	Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
	Fry	Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.
	Professor Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed.
	Leela	Why is that good news?
	Professor Farnsworth	They paid in advance.
	Bender	Excuse me.
	Hermes	This is mighty strange. [He presses a remote control, the lights dim and a holographic display comes up on the table showing a series of planets.] First, the civilisation Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went kaflooie and now Tweenis 12.
	Fry	[pointing] Looks like this planet is next in line.
	Leela	That's Earth. [Fry stares blankly.] The planet we live on.
	Fry	I'd hate to be those guys.
	Hermes	What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word "food".
	Zoidberg	[twitching] What, now?
	Leela	[shouting] No! Nibbler, come back!
	Leela	Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself. [She sees a blue glow coming from a dumpster at the end of the alley.] Nibbler? [She walks closer to it.] Nibbler, you're scaring me. [The lid flips open and one of the brains comes out. Leela screams. She runs away and it chases her. Two more join it and she rolls under a fence. The brains bump into it. She sees Nibbler at the other end of the alley. He is dressed in a blue flight suit and is pulling a tiny spaceship out of a little shed. She gasps.] Nibbler? [He looks at her and climbs into the spaceship. There is a small hole in the roof for his third eye to go into.] Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me? [Nibbler takes off and waves goodbye. The brains fly over the fence and Leela gasps.] [shouting] Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here. [Nibbler lands. Leela hurries into the ship and it blasts off again, knocking the brains out of the way. The ship flies around the Planet Express building and up into space.] Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?
	Fry	Leela back yet?
	Bender	Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!
	Fry	You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
	Bender	Sure ... right. Robot! [He looks at his arms.] Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.
	Fry	Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
	Bender	Am I a robot?
	Fry	Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.
	Bender	Fry! [He gasps.] My skin!
	Professor Farnsworth	Ow. Ow. Ow. [Enter Fry.] I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.
	Fry	Dr. Zoidberg, why is everyone acting so weird?
	Zoidberg	Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now! [He jumps around.] Zoidy want go outside!
	Fry	[angry] I just let you back in!
	Leela	This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk. [Nibbler chatters.] Wait! I understood that! [He chatters again.] You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain. [He says something else.] You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid? [He says something else.] Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe? [Nibbler says something that sounds like "yes".] So, how did the universe begin? [Nibbler tells her.] Then the meaning of existence-- [Nibbler acknowledges.] So every religion is wrong!
	Linda	[on TV] You fell! [She turns to the camera and waves.] Hi! Today some bad things happened. One bad thing was a train got crashed in New Jersey. Wanna see? [The picture cuts to footage of a flaming train wreck.] People won't be late for work though, because the governor lady said, [deeper voice] "I'm sending in more trains!"
	Woman	[on TV] Go!
	Man	[on TV] Wait for me! Wait for me!
	Morbo	[on TV] Morbo can't understand his TelePrompTer. He forgot how you say that letter that looks like a man with a hat.
	Linda	[on TV] It's a "T". It goes "tuh".
	Morbo	[waving; on TV] Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
	Fry	Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?
	Professor Farnsworth	Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!
	Amy	No. Let's buy Internet stock!
	Zoidberg	On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!
	Hermes	Look at me! I'm invisible!
	Fry	Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
	Bender	Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!
	Hermes	Oh, yeah!
	Ken	Welcome back, Lord Nibbler, Ambassador to Earth, homeworld of the pizza bagel.
	Nibbler	Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement.
	Fiona	The four welcomes of friendship to you as well, Leela. We shall manipulate your mind so we appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, my child.
	Leela	I'm not afraid.
	Fiona	Uh, good. Good.
	Leela	So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence.
	Nibbler	That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name, a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal night.
	Leela	Oh, you're all so cute!
	Ken	No, we're not. [He pulls his hood off.] We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race. Behold. [A hologram appears above his head and changes as he narrates.] When the universe was forged in the crucible of the Big Bang, our mighty race was already 17 years old.
	Leela	Aww!
	Ken	For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose a terrible enemy: The Brain Spawn. [The Nibblonians chatter.] Ever since, we have waged unceasing war against these dreadful--
	Nibblonian Chef	Lunch is ready.
	Ken	Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin.
	Leela	So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?
	Nibbler	The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons.
	Ken	Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought in the universe.
	Leela	Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
	Fiona	And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are.
	Nibbler	There is but one being who can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizarre brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack. [The hologram changes to Fry sitting in the Planet Express lounge looking at the soles of his feet.] He is the hope of the universe. [Leela gasps.] The fate of your world, perhaps all worlds, rests in his special mind.
	Leela	Now, when you say "special"...
	Fry	Attention, New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!
	Ken	[on radio] Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known as "Earth".
	Leela	Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
	Fiona	The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave. Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees.
	Nibbler	Fry, however, does not.
	Fiona	Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brain waves into a working mind.
	Leela	Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
	Nibbler	Yes, like your prom dress.
	Ken	The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant, evil brain with a gooey centre of pure hate.
	Fiona	Only Fry, with his superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You must tell him to disable it. We will do the rest.
	Leela	You can count on me.
	Fiona	No, we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message.
	Nibbler	That's why we wrote it down for you.
	Ken	We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.
	Fry	Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents. [He takes a head in a jar out of the box.] This was our first president, George Washington. [The staff stare blankly. Amy twitches and Farnsworth scratches his head.] Let's review. Who was our first president?
	Amy	Um.
	Bender	A pickle jar?
	Washington	Thomas Jefferson?
	Fry	Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?
	Leela	I ... have to tell ... must ... important ... something--
	Fry	Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute.
	Leela	This! You for this!
	Fry	Thanks!
	Leela	No! [She runs over to it and puts her hand in the flame.] Ow! Fire hot.
	Professor Farnsworth	The professy will help! [He puts his hand in and his lab coat catches fire. He screams.] Fire indeed hot!
	Arthur	Oh! Chester A. Arthur fall down.
	Leela	Brain. Brain make people dumb.
	Fry	No, Leela. Brain make people smart.
	Leela	You go fight biggest brain of all.
	Fry	Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
	Leela	[shrugging] I 'unno!
	Fry	Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? [He gasps.] The libary!
	The Big Brain	Pathetic human race. Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb. Dewey, you fool, your decimal system has played right into my hands! [It laughs. Fry pushes the door wide open and he and Leela run in. Before the Big Brain can react, Fry has closed the door and Leela has tipped a bookshelf over so it blocks the door. It gasps.] What do you want?
	Fry	I'm here to kick your ass.
	The Big Brain	Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses. [It flies up towards the ceiling and envelopes Fry's head in a blue glow.] Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think.
	Fry	That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing! [He throws a book at the brain. It bounces of it harmlessly.] OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think! [He rubs his temple.] Thinking ... thinking...
	The Big Brain	Oh! Stop that!
	Fry	Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that. [The Brain groans again.] Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.
	Leela	Duh...
	Fry	Seriously, I can't think of anything. [The Brain laughs, it's strength returning. Fry picks up some books.] Gotta find something to make me think. Hardy Boys, too easy. Nancy Drew, too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!
	The Big Brain	No! It's unbearable!
	Fiona	The brains are weakening. [She presses an intercom button.] Nibblonians to Nibble stations. Prepare cuddle bug for deployment in 40 nibblets.
	Nibbler	Sometimes I fear we are cute.
	Fiona	Oh, niggle-snoosh!
	Fry	Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!
	The Big Brain	You have not won yet. [It's purple glow returns.] Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever.
	Leela	Icky!
	Fry	Where are we?
	Ahab	A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale.
	Queequeg	[pointing] Big whale over there.
	Ahab	Arr! I saw it first!
	Queequeg	Wait! That no white whale. It grey, think-y whale!
	Fry	Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!
	The Big Brain	Farewell! You will all be trapped in this dense, symbolist tome forever!
	Fry	Follow him! It's our only way out!
	Fry	Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?
	Tom Sawyer	Yep. I let him help me whitewash Aunt Polly's fence.
	The Big Brain	Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is less fun than previously indicated. Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity.
	Tom Sawyer	Please, no!
	Fry	[shouting] Come on!
	Woman	Mr. Fry, Mama tells us you're quite the oddity; a bachelor at your age.
	Fry	You think I'm an oddity? Wait'll you see--
	Butler	Presenting the most eligible landowner in all Hertfordshire, Mr. Brainly.
	The Big Brain	I'm a gigantic brain!
	Man #1	I say!
	Man #2	Most un-gentleman-like!
	Woman	Mr. Brainly, what news have you of the London season?
	The Big Brain	Well--
	Fry	Hey, Brain-y! Think fast!
	The Big Brain	I always think fast.
	Ahab	The whale! He be white now!
	Fry	Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg.
	Leela	Is there Mrs. Queequeg?
	Fry	Yes! I'm free! [He begins to climb a bookcase. He stands on the top of it with a book in one hand. He grabs a light with the other.] Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!
	Leela	Fry, don't die! Wake up! [He dies.] [screaming] Nooo!
	Fry	[writing] Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph... [He laughs.] Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end. [He closes the book.] There! [He writes "Fry Trick The Brain" on the cover.] Now he's trapped in a book I wrote; a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.
	The Big Brain	The Big Brain am winning again. I am the greetest! [It laughs.] Now I am leaving Earth for no raeson!
	Nibbler	The Big Brain is defeated. Let what must be done be done.
	Leela	Me ... feel ... a bit better in cognitive faculties.
	Fry	[jumping up] I did it! [He holds up a book and addresses the "camera".] And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.
	Nibbler	[voice-over] And so life returned to normal, or as normal as it gets on this primitive dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes.
	Nibbler	[voice-over] Thanks to the effect of the brain rays, the people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired, except Fry, and no one believed him or cared what he had to say.
	Nibbler	[voice-over] I, meanwhile, returned to my post, ever vigilant, lest Earth again come under Brain attack. And when that day comes, God help us. God help us all.
	Leela	Time for a diap-y change!
	Nibbler	[voice-over] End transmission.
