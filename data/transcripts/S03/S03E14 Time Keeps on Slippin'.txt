	Hermes	Go get it, boy!
	Fry	So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them.
	Leela	Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.
	Fry	Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wha?
	Tate	Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate, commander of the Harlem Globetrotters. [The crowd gasps.] For generations, your puny planet has lived in peace with the Globetrotter Homeworld. But now, for no reason, we challenge you to defend your honour on the basketball court. [The crowd murmurs.] Will no one meet our challenge? Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game?
	Fry	[shouting] What happens if we lose?
	Tate	Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat, beyond the shame of defeat!
	Prof. Farnsworth	This will not stand! [He steps forward and the crowd murmurs.] I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos.
	Tate	You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I may be an old man. In fact, I'm fairly sure I am. But I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!
	Hermes	Hooray, Professor!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Behold: My mutant atomic supermen.
	Leela	They're only a foot high, Professor.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons.
	Bender	Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! You're off to the Tempus Nebula to gather Chronitons.
	Fry	Hey, Leela, look at me!
	Leela	Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
	Fry	There's a lot about my face you don't know! Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.
	Leela	Alright! Cool your jets, hotshot.
	Fry	C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.
	Leela	No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.
	Bender	[shouting] Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!
	Leela	Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
	Prof. Farnsworth	None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker. [He screws a cap onto the bottle and puts it on the side of the cage. The supermen drink the particles and start to grow. One grows extremely tall, another grows an extra three arms, another grows a cannon in the middle of his chest, another turns into a spider and another gets radioactive eyes.] Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.
	Amy	Hi!
	Arachneon	[sexfully] Hello!
	Albert	Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic contest with no surprises whatsoever. [The referee blows the whistle and the game begins.] Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court-- And Curly Joe from the rear.
	Zoidberg	That one grabbed his behindus!
	Leela	Sh!
	Hermes	Quiet!
	Tate	Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you, not tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball to Curly Joe. [He throws the ball and Thorias jumps for it but it springs back into Tate's hand.] Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic. [He laughs and the crowd "boos".] And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces.
	Albert	Goosh goes up. [Armo grabs it.] Rejected! Grotrian from half-court. [He scores.] Yes!
	Albert	Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from downtown! [Thorias puts the ball into his cannon and blasts it into the net.] Yes! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!
	Prof. Farnsworth	No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!
	Albert	And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull, so far. [Arachneon drinks some water and signs some autographs for some kids.] Bubblegum, the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?
	Tate	It was always our plan to trail at the half, thus deepening Earth's eventual humiliation. Also, what game were the refs watching?
	Albert	Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics ... [Curly Joe slides down Grotrian's arms onto the court.] ... continues to wreak havoc on--
	Prof. Farnsworth	What the-- [The crowd mumbles.] Did everything just jump around, or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?
	Albert	Ladies and gentlemen, something very strange has just happened in this basketball game between space clowns and atomic monsters.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Time-out! Time-out!
	Fry	What's happening?
	Prof. Farnsworth	We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player.
	Amy	What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
	Prof. Farnsworth	No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
	Thorias	Oops!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, great! Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man.
	Fry	Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Put me in, Professor. I wanna show Leela my skills.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
	Fry	Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly--
	Albert	Globetrotters win, 244-86. A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been beaten ... in basketball.
	Curly Joe	Yeah, that's how we do it!
	'Sweet' Clyde	How's that?
	Tate	You are all fools of the highest calibre.
	Leela	I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
	Hermes	I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious.
	Tate	Damn right, brother man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy the very matrix of reality.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Tate? What do you know about this?
	Tate	Not much, yet. But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U. And I'd like to help you investigate.
	Prof. Farnsworth	You're that Bubblegum Tate?
	Tate	Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, Prof. [He draws some diagrams on a board.] I think we got ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself.
	Fry	Is that a problem?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; by Wednesday, it will be August; and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it.
	Man	I'll have to ask you to clear out now. The circus need to set up for tomorrow's big--
	Linda	[on TV] Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at 11.
	Linda	[on TV] This is the news at 11. The mysterious and unexplained--
	Linda	[on TV] Turning to entertainment news, teen singer Wendy might just be the latest--
	Linda	[on TV] --won three Grammys last night--
	Linda	[on TV] --found dead in her bathtub.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it.
	Fry	You mean we just--
	Prof. Farnsworth	My, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck, Bubblegum?
	Tate	Not yet. Listen, I hope you don't mind if I dribble a little while I work.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
	Bender	Ooh! Ooh! Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?
	Tate	Shut up, turkey.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly.
	Tate	Good Lord! That sucker's shaking around like some fine, imported booty.
	Hermes	Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just--
	Hermes	I don't know how this was suppose to work.
	Amy	Professor, I hope you find out what's wrong before we skip right past my birth--
	All	--ppy birthday, Amy.
	Amy	Hooray! Look at all these presents!
	Zoidberg	I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth--
	Zoidberg	What?
	Fry	Psst! Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with.
	Leela	Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.
	Leela	How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
	Fry	[sexfully] Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still.
	Fry	Ow!
	Zoidberg	Hmm. [He hovers his claw over it.] Hmm.
	Leela	Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?
	Zoidberg	Leela, I would be honoured.
	Leela	--does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!
	Zoidberg	Sorry, you must have been boring me.
	Leela	The thing is, Fry is very sweet, but he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness.
	Zoidberg	So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg! [He cries then suddenly stops.] You were saying?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, there is it. The Tempus Nebula. Take a whiff through the Smellescope.
	Tate	What's that funky jazz?
	Prof. Farnsworth	The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe.
	Bender	Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it.
	Tate	Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the nebula bounce-passes them off us ... [He throws the balls at Bender and they dent his head.] ... they cause these dents, or "time skips".
	Bender	You are so smart!
	Tate	Hold up. What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic co-ordinates?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.
	Tate	Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity pump. And we'd need all the money on Earth to--
	Tate	What the--
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wha?
	Richard Nixon	Here's the funding for your gravity pump. But it damn well better work! We can't spend all of Earth's money every day. Now, how long will it take to build?
	Tate	It won't be easy, Nixon. A jim-jam this complex might take months or even--
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. [The gravity pump is huge and has a basketball on the end.] Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th--
	Prof. Farnsworth	[waving] Off you go, apparently.
	Tate	[from ship] Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll that star to the cosmic basket.
	Leela	Just a few ... more ... hundred ... thousand ... miles. There!
	Tate	[from ship] Nothing but nebula!
	Leela	We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips.
	Bender	Alright!
	Tate	Jamming!
	Fry	Hooray for Leela!
	Bender	And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
	Tate	Let me see. [Bender takes the crude uniform out of his chest cabinet and Tate rubs his hands together.] Hello, lawsuit!
	Fry	Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something.
	Leela	Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?
	Fry	You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are.
	Leela	Aw! That is so true and sweet.
	Fry	You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-e?
	Leela	Fry, please try to understand: You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different.
	Bender	Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?
	Leela	Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters.
	Fry	I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?
	Tate	86 the chump stuff, F-man. It's time to win Leela's heart with a big-showy, three-point romantic gesture.
	Fry	Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
	Leela	Fry, what are you doing?
	Tate	Uh-oh. Time to boogie on down to the sauna!
	Fry	Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
	Leela	Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off.
	Fry	I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So, are we dating now?
	Leela	Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now.
	Fry	Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is--
	Leela	Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever--
	Preacherbot	--man and wife. You may kiss the bride.
	Albert	Yes!
	Zoidberg	He looks radiant!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ye Gods, Bubblegum! We failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all.
	Tate	Even in these formal shorts, I feel like a failure.
	Leela	You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?
	Fry	Of course not.
	Leela	How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
	Fry	No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work--
	Whitey	Divorce is final.
	Fry	What?
	Leela	Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets.
	Fry	Fine. Break my heart again.
	Zoidberg	Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg.
	Fry	How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
	Hermes	Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry.
	Amy	Um, no.
	Fry	I don't know what I'm doing.
	Bender	Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?
	Tate	Hell, no.
	Fry	Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty.
	Zoidberg	[sexfully] Zoidberg!
	Prof. Farnsworth	No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your show-boating Globetrotter algebra.
	Tate	Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razz-ma-tazz. A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes.
	Bender	Vintage Bubblegum!
	Prof. Farnsworth	The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look.
	Boy	Stupid senior citizens. Why should we have to pay for their social security benefits?
	Old Man	I deserve free money!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ--
	Prof. Farnsworth	Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?
	Curly Joe	No, man. An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe.
	Sweet Clyde	You gotta Globetrotter that explosion up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion.
	Prof. Farnsworth	By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping.
	Tate	Whoa. Slow that brain train down, Prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday device to initiate an implosion like that.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Doomsday device? Ah! Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! [He presses a button and a machine rises out of the floor.] I suppose I could part with one and still be feared.
	Tate	Give me some skin, Prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter.
	Amy	Hooray!
	Hermes	Yes!
	Zoidberg	I'm a Globetrotter!
	Bender	[gasping] Did you just say--
	Tate	Too late, hot plate.
	Bender	Oh, crap.
	Tate	We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.
	Bender	Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller.
	Tate	Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your heart and ask yourself: Are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you?
	Bender	Yes.
	Tate	Are you?
	Bender	I mean, with time, my funk level could--
	Tate	Are you?
	Bender	[sadly] No.
	Tate	Deal with it.
	Bender	Oh! No!
	Leela	[on radio] Careful with that doomsday device, Bender.
	Bender	What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless.
	Leela	[on radio] Roger.
	Fry	Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry.
	Leela	It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?
	Fry	Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.
	Leela	I guess not.
	Bender	Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.
	Leela	OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance. [She is about to sit down when she sees Fry still looking sad.] Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?
	Fry	She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
	Bender	Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.
	Fry	Oh! [He walks to the window and presses his face against the glass. As the ship gets further away from the nebula Fry sees the stars around it form an "O" in a huge message that reads "I Love You, Leela".] That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.
	Leela	[on intercom] Detonation in three, two, one.
	Fry	[screaming] No! [The doomsday device implodes and the nebula, the stars and Fry's message disappear. Fry stares at the empty void. Leela and Bender walk in.] Did you see it? Did you see it?
	Bender	The explosion?
	Fry	No, not the explosion!
	Leela	Then what?
	Fry	[quietly] Nothing.
