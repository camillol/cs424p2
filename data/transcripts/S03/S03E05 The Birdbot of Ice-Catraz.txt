	Leela	Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash.
	Bender	Ah!
	Leela	And, Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice--
	Bender	Thank you.
	Leela	But it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
	Bender	So? It's not like it's the only one we've got.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission.
	Fry	Controversial?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, my, no.
	Prof. Farnsworth	For this highly controversial mission you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter.
	Leela	Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Impossible! [He presses a button and an enlarged holographic cross-section of the tanker appears.] The tanker has 6,000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof. [He points at a new hologram with the fing-longer.] Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors--
	Leela	Protestors?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Correct. 6,000 hulls.
	Leela	Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
	Prof. Farnsworth	[whispering] To avoid the tollbooth.
	Fry	OK, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going.
	Leela	At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look, Professor, I can't participate in this mission.
	Prof. Farnsworth	What are you yapping about?
	Leela	This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors.
	Prof. Farnsworth	This is an outrage! I demand you hand over your captain's jacket.
	Leela	This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I said hand it over! [She takes it off, throws it at him and storms out.] Well, Fry, or should I say Captain Fry? [He holds the jacket out to him then pulls it away.] No, I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!
	Fry	Bender?
	Prof. Farnsworth	That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job.
	Bender	Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
	Fry	No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew.
	Zoidberg	Ooh! The new one's out!
	Bender	Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic. [He puts a blue Napoleon-like hat on and stands up.] Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!
	Waterfall Sr.	Greetings, Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall Sr., founder of Penguins Unlimited. [The crowd applauds.] Whoa! No, no! No applause. Every time you clap your hands you kill thousands of spores that'll some day form a nutritious fungus. Just show your approval with a mould-friendly thumbs up. [The crowd thumbs-ups.] Please hold your thumbs until the end. Now, folks, it's time to stop that tanker with a non-violent human circle.
	Leela	[standing up] Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
	Waterfall Sr.	Now, little lady, those people's asses are living things too.
	Bender	Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men.
	Fry	I am at ease.
	Bender	Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!
	Fry	The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?
	Bender	I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
	Fry	Always respect the chain o' command ... captain.
	Bender	Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table
	Zoidberg	[whispering] The captain's table! What an honour!
	Waterfall Sr.	Our peace ring has 'em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine!
	Leela	Get ready!
	Protestor #1	Look out!
	Protestor #2	Hold on!
	Waterfall Sr.	Here they come!
	Leela	When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?
	Waterfall Sr.	No, I did not.
	Waterfall Sr.	Folks, that tanker gave us the slip, but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto. If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns. [He picks up some snow, puts his hand down his trousers and rubs it around.] If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey, I don't wanna be right!
	Waterfall Sr.	This here is our penguin preserve.
	Leela	Aw! They're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
	Waterfall Sr.	We use hand puppets around the young'uns to simulate a natural environment.
	Leela	That's adorable!
	Bender	But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it.
	Zoidberg	Brilliant!
	Fry	Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!
	Bender	Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
	Fry	Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ... [Bender swirls his glass around.] ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt.
	Bender	Eh, I've heard better.
	Fry	If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
	Bender	Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!
	Fry	Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
	Bender	Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate.
	Zoidberg	You can drink with me maybe?
	Bender	I don't feel like drinking.
	Zoidberg	Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it. [Bender walks through it.] Three.
	Bender	[singing] Oh, Greenland is a barren land,A land that bears no green,Where there's ice and snow,And the whale fishes blow,And the--
	Zoidberg	Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function.
	Bender	[sober] Gah! I once knew a guy ... you look like him. But he wasn't either. [His hat tumbles off and he groans.] I'm a good captain.
	Zoidberg	Please, sir, I love you like a father!
	Protestor #3	Here they come. Oh, I hope they read my sign!
	Leela	Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
	Protestor #3	He must be talking on a cell phone!
	Fry	What's happening?
	Zoidberg	All 6,000 hulls have been breached!
	Fry	Oh, the fools! If only they'd built it with 6,001 hulls! When will they learn?
	Linda	[solemn; on TV] Continuing our coverage of a tragic [upbeat] but far away [solemn] story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat. The images are truly horrific.
	Leela	[on TV] I don't think any of us can understand how those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel.
	Morbo	[on TV] Oily humanoid! [Linda chuckles.] At the time of the crash, the tanker captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent -- well below the legal limit for robots.
	Hyper-Chicken	Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
	Bender	Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?
	Hyper-Chicken	I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetence!
	Bender	Yeah, uh, good luck with that.
	Leela	Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
	Waterfall Sr.	Good way to avoid frostbite, folks: Put your hands between your buttocks. That's nature's pocket.
	Leela	Uh ... I think I'll go check on Bender.
	Waterfall Sr.	Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket.
	Bender	Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!
	Leela	Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished? [She runs her finger over a penguin's black feathers.] And clean the black parts too.
	Smitty	Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?
	URL	It don't matter, baby, they're all beautiful!
	Bender	Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? [He sees them hugging.] Oh, ho! What's this?
	URL	Aw, man! He got away!
	Smitty	I guess this is why Chief says no hugging.
	Waterfall Sr.	Good work, everyone. I suggest you all go get some sleep. Me, well, I'm gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine, piercing tenor.
	Leela	Has anyone seen Bender? [shouting] Bender? [She pats her knee.] Here robot, robot, robot.
	Leela	Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?
	Zoidberg	They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job. [Yolk drips from his mouth.] [ashamed] And eating penguin eggs.
	Fry	You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?
	Zoidberg	Damnit, Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain.
	Leela	I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
	Fry	He didn't?
	Leela	No, and with wind-chill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.
	Fry	Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. [He puts on Leela's jacket and Bender's hat.] To the ship.
	Leela	Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
	Fry	Madam, I am in command now.
	Zoidberg	Such a man! I'd follow him to hell and back, I would.
	Bender	What the--? [The penguins and he dive into some water. Bender comes up to the surface.] What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!
	Penguin #1	[in penguin] Full of fish?
	Bender	[in penguin] Not entirely.
	Penguin #1	[in penguin] Then let's fish.
	Zoidberg	Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it.
	Fry	Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
	Zoidberg	[shouting] Stop yelling at me!
	Waterfall Sr.	Folks, it's worse than we thought. Seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a perverted trail mix of penguin oestrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile.
	Leela	How ultra?
	Waterfall Sr.	Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes. [The hippies gasp.] Also, the eggs hatch in only 12 hours. [The hippies gasp again.] Also, the males are laying eggs.
	Doctor	This man is over-gasped.
	Waterfall Sr.	If the birds keep multiplying there'll soon be too many to count. [Behind him a video clip of a skinny penguin appears.] Before long the penguins will exhaust their food supply and starve to death.
	Leela	Oh, if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?
	Waterfall Sr.	Yes, I reckon it is our responsibility. And thankfully we have a plan.
	Leela	What is it? We'll do anything.
	Waterfall Sr.	Everyone, grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open.
	Leela	You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding?
	Waterfall Sr.	Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Now surely you agree that a quick, semi-painless death is a damn sight better than weeks of starvation.
	Leela	Well, I suppose... But-- I mean-- I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them.
	Waterfall Sr.	This time the two are one and the same! Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer?
	Leela	[crying] Oh, God! It's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
	Waterfall Sr.	That's a good old-fashioned gun. Simple point-and-click interface. Rifle check!
	Hunter #1	Oh, yeah!
	Hunter #2	Wee doggy!
	Leela	Hey, you're enjoying this.
	Waterfall Sr.	Look, nobody enjoys shooting penguins. But if you have to shoot penguins, well, you might as well enjoy it.
	Leela	I'm sorry, but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.
	Waterfall Sr.	Oh, really? How 'bout blowing up dams?
	Leela	Yeah ... that is fun.
	Waterfall Sr.	Let's conservate!
	Zoidberg	[shouting; from ship] It's been an honour to serve under you, sir!
	Leela	Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families. [She looks down the gunsight.] But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I-I can't look. [She shakes as she starts to squeeze the trigger. A tear streams down her face. She shoots and the penguins squawk and run away.] [crying] Oh, no! What have I done? [She runs down the hillside. The penguins are gathered around a dead penguin. Leela falls to her knees and cries.] Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender? [Bender opens his eyes and resets to Human Mode. He loads the human language and brings up his task list. 1] Bend. 2] Cheese It! He stands up and takes the bullet out of his head. Leela stops crying.] What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?
	Bender	Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo! [The penguins rub against him.] Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
	Leela	Aw! They love you!
	Bender	Well I don't love them. [A baby penguin looks up at him and cheeps.] Aw! [He regurgitates some food into it's mouth. Leela looks away.] I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!
	Penguins	[in penguin] Stand still. It's our only hope.
	Bender	[in penguin] That's puffin talk. Now follow me!
	Leela	Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.
	Hunter #2	Sorry.
	Waterfall Sr.	Why aren't you firing randomly into those birds, little lady? Don't you wanna help 'em?
	Leela	Not this way.
	Waterfall Sr.	What? Why you're not a tree-hugging kook at all!
	Leela	Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun.
	Waterfall Sr.	Leela, you may just be farming some free-range truth there. [Leela smiles.] On the other hand, we already made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. OK, boys, it's them or us!
	Leela	No!
	Waterfall Sr.	Hey! Where'd they--
	Bender	[shouting] Attack!
	Hunter #1	Whoa!
	Hunter #2	Ow!
	Bender	[in penguin] We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
	Waterfall Sr.	[shouting] Make sure they use every part of my body!
	Old Man Waterfall	[shouting] I'll avenge your death, son!
	Leela	They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
	Bender	Yep. It's like I taught 'em: If it ain't black and white, peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo. [He takes it off and puts it in his chest cabinet. The penguins turn away from Waterfall and move towards Leela and Bender.] Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!
	Leela	Oh, if only we had a toboggan.
	Bender	Faster! Faster!
	Leela	Phew!
	Bender	Oh, phew! [The penguins dive into the water and swim towards the ice block.] Oh, right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.
	Leela	It's Fry!
	Bender	Wiggles?
	Leela	Well, at least it'll help reduce their population.
	Bender	Yeah, life is hilariously cruel. [He laughs then slips over and slides down towards the open mouth of the whale. The cargo bay lift comes down and Fry grabs Bender's hand.] Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?
	Fry	Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
	Bender	Oh, and bring my toboggan.
	Fry	So, Leela, were you able to help the penguins?
	Leela	Well, sure. I mean ... not really. I mean ... nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things, right?
	Fry	[mumbling] I 'unno.
	Bender	Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine.
