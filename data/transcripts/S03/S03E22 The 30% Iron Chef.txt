	Morbo	[on TV] Welcome back. Our next guest has been teaching the world to cook for over 20 years. But apparently my, uh, wife hasn't been listening.
	Linda	[on TV] Oh, funny!
	Morbo	[shouting; on TV] I will destroy her! [talking] And now, extend a formulaic greeting to master chef Elzar. [The sound of cheering is heard and Morbo walks into a studio kitchen where Elzar smiles and waves.] So, uh, Elzar, what will you be cooking for Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?
	Elzar	[on TV] Morbo, I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond, with mango chutney.
	Morbo	[on TV] Pathetic humans, prepare to write down the recipe!
	Fry	Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?
	Bender	Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends.
	Fry	Brunch. Right. I'd better warn-- tell-- warntell the others!
	Bender	Okey-dokey!
	Hermes	Ooh!
	Leela	Nice!
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring.
	Zoidberg	Oh!
	Professor Farnsworth	Get--! [He snatches it away.] For the last time, Zoidberg, look with your eyes, not with your claws.
	Fry	Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.
	Zoidberg	Oh, boy!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, God! My tract!
	Fry	He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
	Leela	Alright, don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks.
	Fry	Hurry!
	Professor Farnsworth	Good idea!
	Zoidberg	What's the hold-up?
	Bender	Fleeing somewhere?
	Fry	With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly.
	Bender	In that case brunch is served! Let's go! Move it out! Stop crying, Leela!
	Professor Farnsworth	Zoidberg, are you coming?
	Zoidberg	Sure. Me.
	Professor Farnsworth	Because I don't want you touching that thing.
	Zoidberg	I know that. [Farnsworth leaves and Zoidberg picks up the bottle.] Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg! [He wiggles his mouth flaps inside the bottle and breaks off part of the ship. He screams and cuts the bottle in half.] Oh, no! Professor will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts! [He picks up some "Strong Force Krazy Glue" but squeezes the bottle too soon and the glue squirts all over him. He screams and steps back. He turns around and some lab equipment and a sign reading "Zoidberg: Don't Touch!" gets stuck to him.] Ow! What? Oh!
	Bender	Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony. [Everyone gasps. The pony leg on Amy's plate still has a horseshoe on the hoof.] Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove.
	Hermes	This is terrible!
	Professor Farnsworth	Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table.
	Amy	Where does the other end come out?
	Professor Farnsworth	You know, I'm not quite sure. [He peers into the wormhole. The food falls from above and onto his head.] Oh, dear me!
	Bender	The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?
	Zoidberg	Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally. [The clock goes off and the cuckoo hits Zoidberg in the face.] Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!
	Leela	How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg. Do go on.
	Bender	Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!
	Fry	[from lounge] Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings...
	Fry	But this food actually tastes better as vomit!
	Leela	It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
	Bender	[crying] And this time I mean it.
	Bender	Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that. [He cries then looks up. He is standing outside Elzar's restaurant.] Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!
	Elzar	Absolutely not.
	Bender	But I watch your show. You owe me!
	Elzar	I owe you nothing! For starter's, your antenna's in my crotch. Also, I hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat.
	Bender	What was the first one again?
	Elzar	I hate you.
	Bender	I thought that was number two.
	Elzar	I knocked it up a notch. Bam!
	Zoidberg	Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca. [He cries then stops.] Wait! What would the robot do? [He thinks.] Frame someone!
	Fry	What up?
	Fry	[singing] I'm walking on sunshine! [He hums and gargles.] Sunshine!
	Bender	[crying] It's over! My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on!
	Dandy Jim	Gus, old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo.
	Bender	What did you call me?
	Gus	A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.
	Bender	Oh, OK. I thought you said "romo".
	Dandy Jim	No offence intended, my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space rails?
	Gus	Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead.
	Dandy Jim	We're going nearly the speed of light so, uh, roll when you land.
	Bender	Ow.
	Gus	Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.
	Bender	I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon. [Someone puts a pie on a windowsill. The two hobos smell it and literally float towards it with the help of their jetpacks.] Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?
	Gus	Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef ever.
	Dandy Jim	His restaurant was so high-toned, the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations.
	Gus	Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.
	Bender	Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
	Spargle	Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...
	Spargle	[voice-over] Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old-fashioned.
	Man	Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger more extreme cooking show viewer.
	Spargle	Elzar!
	Elzar	Get lost, old man! Bam!
	Spargle	Mein soufflé!
	Spargle	Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette!
	Bender	That twizzler!
	Spargle	As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here, making pies out of shoes.
	Bender	My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
	Spargle	Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste.
	Bender	It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste.
	Spargle	You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever.
	Bender	I could?
	Spargle	Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf.
	Bender	Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
	Spargle	Bender, hear me well. I shall train you. But first, you must forget everything you know about cooking.
	Bender	Done.
	Professor Farnsworth	That's right, Ricardo. A ship in a bottle! What's that? Well hang on, I'll look.
	Ricardo	[on phone] Ola? Professor? Qué pasa?
	Professor Farnsworth	I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker.
	Zoidberg	I'm acting astonished.
	Professor Farnsworth	Certain clues suggest that the culprit is none other than our own ... Philip J. Fry!
	Fry	What?
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, it was a brilliant scheme. But you made one fatal mistake ... leaving this confession note.
	Zoidberg	Fry, you scoundrel!
	Fry	Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself.
	Professor Farnsworth	Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials: $10.
	Fry	There you go.
	Zoidberg	[shouting] What have I done?
	Spargle	Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess, so must you serve at least one edible meal. [quietly] Succeed and I shall reveal to you the age-old secret [whispering] of perfect flavour.
	Gus	Ooh, yeah!
	Bender	[shouting] Slop's on!
	Gus	Fine lookin' eats!
	Spargle	It is ... acceptable.
	Bender	Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating, master?
	Spargle	[hoarse] Because ... my stomach is about to explode.
	Bender	What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!
	Spargle	[hoarse] Oh, it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing is that you defeat Elzar after I am gone. [He takes something out of his pocket.] And using this, you cannot fail.
	Bender	A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?
	Spargle	[hoarse] No. It is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause the inner perfection of any dish to blossom forth. [His stomach explodes.] Oh! There goes my ... life.
	Bender	I'll avenge you, master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!
	Gus	Oh, I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill. But I likes what what you said!
	Bender	Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!
	Elzar	Why, you--
	Bender	Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says [hoarse] "Ooh, I'm dead!"
	Elzar	Spargle, huh? What he do, bland himself to death?
	Bender	No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
	Elzar	OK, but it seems like you're the one who killed him.
	Bender	Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
	Customer	Scandalous!
	Elzar	Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum. Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.
	Bender	Iron Cook, eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron! [He bangs his body.] You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under "Dr. Bender".
	Hiroki	Please welcome the superintendent of Kitchen Coliseum, Chairman Koji! [A spotlight lights up Koji who has his foot on a white tiger.] No robot chef has ever competed here but today one has barged his way in to challenge for the title of...
	Koji	Iron Cookuru!
	Fry	[shouting] Yeah! You show 'em!
	Hiroki	Let's meet today's celebrity judges: Captain of the Harlem Globetrotters, Ethan Bubblegum Tate.
	Tate	Konnichiwa, brother!
	Hiroki	TV anchor-monster, Morbo.
	Morbo	Greetings, pathetic host.
	Hiroki	And a woman who ended a thousand-year galactic war with her apple dandies, Martha Stewart's head.
	Stewart	The secret is fresh pork.
	Hiroki	And now, Chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish today.
	Bender	[quietly] If it's chicken, chicken c la king; if it's fish, fish à la king; if it's turkey, fish à la king.
	Koji	Soylent Greuu!
	Hiroki	Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourmet cooking. And the battle is on. [Bender and Elzar scoop soylent green blocks from the pile onto their trays and carry them to their kitchens. A cameraman points the camera at Elzar who is cutting the blocks of soylent green. Hiroki talks to a woman in a green suit with a microphone.] Aki, what's Elzar making?
	Aki	Well, Hiroki-san, when I asked him, he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute.
	Stewart	In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds.
	Female Announcer	[voice-over] 30 minutes to go.
	Hiroki	Look at Bender roll that dough!
	Tate	I've never seen such confident, powerful strokes of the ass!
	Stewart	You've never seen mine!
	Tate	[sexfully] No, I haven't!
	Female Announcer	[voice-over] Fifteen minutes remaining.
	Hiroki	The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation, a working pastry replica of downtown Venice.
	Man	[shouting] Commemorative turkey basters. Get your commemorative turkey basters.
	Fry	Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything. [He open his wallet but it is empty.] Oh, right. Never mind.
	Zoidberg	Oh, the guilt! The unbearable guilt!
	Female Announcer	[voice-over] Fifteen seconds.
	Elzar	Bam!
	Female Announcer	[voice-over] Ten seconds.
	Bender	Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you.
	Koji	Time uperuu!
	Hiroki	The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think.
	Tate	Mmm. Soylent green is my kind of people!
	Morbo	Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion.
	Stewart	I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing.
	Hiroki	Next up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Helmut Spargle, Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man.
	Stewart	Ooh, delicious!
	Tate	This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of fun-kay!
	Morbo	The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on the inside.
	Hiroki	And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser is doomed to scrub. [Dirty pots and pans are piled around a sink.] Whose confection will achieve perfection? Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff?
	Koji	Challengeruu Benderuu!
	Fry	Yay!
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] That's my robot! I own him!
	Bender	You honour me, Chairman Koji.
	Koji	Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.
	Bender	Chairman-san, I came here with one goal: To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I've done that.
	Elzar	No question.
	Bender	But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of "Zinc Saucier", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money.
	Zoidberg	Wait! Everyone must know: I broke the Professor's bottled ship. [The audience gasps.] And what is worse, I framed my dearest friend, Fry! [crying] I can never repay him his ten dollars, so I must take the only honourable path. What the killing myself. [He takes Koji's sword and rips his shirt open. More gasps.] Here I go, already. [He stabs himself but the sword crumples as it hits his shell.] Huh?
	Koji	Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!
	Zoidberg	Fry did it!
	Bender	And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
	Leela	Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it again on TV.
	Professor Farnsworth	Hmm. Let me see that vial, Bender. [He takes it and puts it in a microwave-like machine. A readout prints and he looks at it and gasps.] Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was ... water. Ordinary water!
	Hermes	No!
	Fry	Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
	Bender	The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... "confidence"?
	Leela	I'm in!
	Professor Farnsworth	I do!
