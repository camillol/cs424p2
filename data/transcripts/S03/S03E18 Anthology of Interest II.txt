	Prof. Farnsworth	There. I've finished fine-tuning my What-If machine. It can answer any "What-If" question, accurate to within one-tenth of a plausibility unit.
	Leela	That's so plausible I can't believe it!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
	Bender	Ooh! Ooh! I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants. [He holds a microphone on the machine.] What if Bender were human?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Good news, everyone! I've invented a way to turn Bender into a human using a process I call "reverse fossilisation".
	Leela	How does it work?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon.
	Fry	Kinda game-y.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Are you ready, Bender?
	Bender	I dunno. I'm beginning to have some second thoughts--
	Hermes	Cover your shame, mon!
	Prof. Farnsworth	It worked! Eat it, everyone whose never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you, Amy!
	Bender	So this is a human body, huh? Neat! [He feels the top of his head.] Hey, my antenna's gone. [He looks at his crotch.] No, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little.
	Fry	[whispering] Bender, no! You'll make God cry.
	Bender	Well, let's see what kinda things this body can do. [He spits and Hermes leans out the way of it.] Hey, that's pretty fun. [He vomits and laughs.] Being human is great!
	Zoidberg	Hooray! It's just like Mardis Gras!
	Bender	Guy! Guys! You've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!
	Leela	Bender, it's OK to be proud but don't be a show-off.
	Bender	Whoa! You look a lot better than you used to for some reason.
	Amy	[sexfully] You're not so bad yourself, big boy.
	Bender	Hey, that felt great! [He kisses Farnsworth.] Nah, it's not working anymore.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Speak for yourself!
	Bender	Whoa! This is awesome!
	Leela	Bender, you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
	Bender	But now it's bad for me!
	Fry	Speaking of which, try these nachos.
	Bender	Mmm! Why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good? [Miami Sound Machine's Conga plays and Bender's hips wiggle.] What's going on? That rhythm! It's doing something to my human butt.
	Amy	Bender, part of being human is having self control.
	Bender	Oh, my God! I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!
	Amy	No, Bender!
	Hermes	No!
	Leela	Stop him.
	Bender	Let me go.
	Leela	No!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Come, Bender. It's time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize Committee. Bender?
	Bender	[shouting] Goodbye, moderation!
	Zoidberg	Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he, already?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Uh, as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, um...
	Fry	[whispering] Pst! We found him!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Ah! Then without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges the first robot ever turned into a human.
	Wernstrom	My God! He needs medical attention!
	Zoidberg	Pulse, 300; liver, failing; cholesterol, 40?
	Leela	Well, that's not so bad.
	Zoidberg	No, I mean 40 pounds!
	Prof. Farnsworth	This, um, scientific breakthrough ... heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations, yes.
	Bender	C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. [The woman cringes.] Hey, you like grilled cheese?
	Prof. Farnsworth	And, um, that's why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize.
	Wernstrom	Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy of Science.
	Bender	Wait! As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves.
	Wernstrom	Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore--
	Bender	[shouting] Party!
	Wernstrom	Bender, you were right! Truly you have lived more in your one week of being human than the rest of us have in our entire lives.
	Bender	Woo!
	Wernstrom	And so, to recognise your achievements, I hereby award you the Nobel Prize ... [He takes a medal off a sleeping scientist.] ... in, uh ... [He reads the medal.] ... Chemistry.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Care to say a few words, Bender?
	Fry	He's dead.
	Wernstrom	When did he die?
	Prof. Farnsworth	About 12 hours ago when the party started.
	Wernstrom	But he just said, "Woo."
	Prof. Farnsworth	No, that was air escaping from the folds of his fat. [He pushes the fat and Bender "Woo's" again.] Goodnight, sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well, let's get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint.
	Narrator	[voice-over] You watched it, you can't un-watch it. Stay tuned for more Tales of Interest!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanthor?
	Fry	Ooh, I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Can you put that in the form of a question?
	Fry	Uh, what if that thing I said?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, great machine, we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?
	Richard Nixon	[on TV] Good evening, ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention as I sign an historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of planet Nintendu 64.
	Fry	Wait a second! I know that monkey. His name is Donkey.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Monkeys aren't donkeys! Quit messing with my head!
	Richard Nixon	I'll just put the old "John Q. Nixon" on it. [An arm comes out of his jar and he signs the paper "Richard M. Nixon's Head".] There! No major crap-ups. You're on, Mr. Ambassador. [Donkey Kong turns towards Nixon.] What the--
	Mario	Mama Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white pants of peace!
	Man	Mr. Fry, rumour has it you know the secrets of the video game Chance. Please step into the war room.
	Man	You'll be meeting with General Colin Pac-Man.
	Pac-Man	Wakka, wakka, wakka, wakka. Let's get down to business. What can you tell us about the Nintendians?
	Fry	Well, sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them, except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion--
	Pac-Man	Quickly! To the escape tunnels!
	Pac-Man	This way, damnit!
	Zoidberg	Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmallows! [The cherry appears in front of him.] Ooh, and a cherry!
	Fry	Hey, watch out!
	Zoidberg	Uh-oh!
	Leela	Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead!
	Fry	It's OK. I had another guy!
	Pac-Man	[gasping] Wakka ... wakka, wa--
	Leela	[pointing] Invaders! Possibly from space!
	Lrrr	People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Nintendu 64. Tremble in fear at our three different kinds of ships.
	Fry	Alright! It's Saturday night, I have no date, a two-litre bottle of Shasta and my all-Rush mix tape. Let's rock!
	Nd-Nd	We're losing ships, Lrrr. What are your orders?
	Lrrr	Increase speed, drop down and reverse direction!
	Fry	I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch, as I fire upwards through our own shields.
	Bender	He's a madman! A madman!
	Pac-Man	It's working! Victory is assured. My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter. [Some Nintendian missiles come through the roof and take a chunk out of Pac-Man. He screams.] I'm hit! So cold!
	Ms. Pac-Man	[crying] No!
	Fry	Amy, tend to the widow Pac-Man.
	Ms. Pac-Man	[crying] Wakka, wakka, wakka.
	Lrrr	Drop down and increase speed.
	Zoidberg	[from inside] One ship is left only.
	Leela	Come on, Fry! Get it!
	Fry	[sweating] It's moving too fast! Oh, I could never get the last one. My brother always got it for me.
	Lrrr	Drop down, reverse direction, prepare for landing.
	Lrrr	You are defeated. Instead of shooting where I was, you should have shot at where I was going to be.
	Beserk	All your base are belong to us.
	Q-Bert	[speaking backwards] Where can a guy get a pair of pants around here?
	Fry	What do you monsters want?
	Donkey Kong	One thing and one thing only: Quarters! A million allowances worth of quarters! No slugs or tokens.
	Beserk	Fork 'em over! Fork 'em over!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Forget it, you pixilated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.
	Amy	Yeah!
	Bender	Right on!
	Leela	Sure thing, Professor!
	Lrrr	But-But space invaders need to do laundry too. I mean look at Donkey Kong here. Have you smelled his loincloth lately?
	Zoidberg	Yes.
	Amy	Go away! We're not giving you our quarters no matter what.
	Lrrr	Well ... then what if we throw our laundry in with yours? Would that be acceptable?
	Fry	I guess so.
	Lrrr	OK, then. That settles that. But if this cape shrinks, consider your species extinct!
	Narrator	[voice-over] Bravo! That'll be hard to top. I pity the next Tale of Interest.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the "Who Ask" machine to see who's next.
	Who Ask Machine	Um, uh, um ... Amy. [Amy gasps.] I mean Leela.
	Leela	OK. [She clears her throat.] As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere.
	Bender	Boo-hoo.
	Fry	Ow!
	Bender	Uh ... where?
	Leela	So my question is this: What if I found my true home? [Farnsworth pulls a lever like on a one-armed bandit and hits Leela on the head.] Ow!
	Leela	Where are we?
	Leela	Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore. [She looks around the coloured landscape. A peacock open it's tail like the NBC logo.] Jeez! Apparently the phrase "tone it down" doesn't exist on this planet. [She sees Scruffy has been squashed under the steps.] Oh, no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ship. [She hesitates.] Ooh! Nice boots!
	Cubert	Look, everyone! She killed the Man-Witch of the West!
	Leela	A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.
	Glurmo	No, you stole them. We saw you.
	Leela	Well ... i-it's hard to find shoes that fit me. So, anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?
	Glurmo	[singing] We resemble but are legally distinct from the lollipop guild, the lollipop--
	Amy	Greetings, Leela. I'm the Cute Witch of the North!
	Leela	Yeah... Can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?
	Amy	Abraca-duh! Just ask the Professor. He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard.
	Leela	You mean that yellow brick road?
	Amy	The city council renamed it in 1975. [sarcastic] Ooh! Those are great shoes!
	Leela	Oh, thank you.
	Amy	Do they come in women's sizes?
	Fry	OK, crow, prepare to be scared. [He gets out Stephen King's Christine.] [reading] And then, "honk, honk," the car honked its own horn!
	Leela	Wow! A talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain.
	Fry	Hey! That's not a nice thing to say.
	Bender	Beer! Beer!
	Leela	Whiskey OK?
	Bender	Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart -- a human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
	Zoidberg	And I'm the other guy, courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname.
	Mom	Damn this DSL! [She cackles and opens a cage, letting out her flying monkey-sons.] Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them!
	Igner	But, Mom, you promised you'd bake monkey cake today.
	Mom	By "monkey cake" I meant your ass!
	Fry	Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz.
	Zoidberg	What, do I smell or something?
	Leela	Why did you bring us here?
	Zoidberg	And why did I have to take a cab?
	Mom	I'll tell you why I brought you here, you twice-baked barf bags: Because I've always wanted a daughter to love. You want to get adopted, you little skank?
	Leela	And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox.
	Mom	Absolutely.
	Leela	Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!
	Bender	Hooray!
	Zoidberg	Alright!
	Fry	That's great, Leela.
	Bender	I've heard worse excuses to drink. [He opens the bottle and it sprays over Mom.] Oops!
	Mom	I'm melting! Oh, who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me?
	Bender	Well, no point letting her go to waste.
	Hermes	[from inside] Yes?
	Leela	We're here to see the Professor.
	Hermes	[from inside] No one sees the mighty Professor.
	Prof. Farnsworth	[from inside] Who's there, Hermes? Is it visitors? I want to see them.
	Hermes	[shouting; from inside] It's nobody. Now sign that will I gave you! [He turns to Leela.] He's not here.
	Leela	Oh, for the love of Benji!
	Prof. Farnsworth	I am the Professor, great and ... uh ... forgetful! [Nibbler pulls back the curtain revealing Farnsworth's big head on a small body.] Now, what do you nice kids want?
	Zoidberg	Nothing! I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun?
	Zoidberg	No, world, you put your hands up!
	Prof. Farnsworth	And you, lad, all you need is brain.
	Fry	Why does everyone keep saying that?
	Bender	This is a stick-up. Gimme the bag, old man!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Here you go, my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks.
	Bender	Oh, crap.
	Prof. Farnsworth	As for you, young lady, you want to go home, right?
	Leela	No, not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Nonsense. Now click your big, honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poverty with your dirt-farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle.
	Leela	Uh, alright. Here I go. [She clicks her boots together three times.] There's no place like-- I wanna be a witch! [She turns into a witch, complete with pointed hat. Everyone gasps and she turns Fry, Farnsworth and Bender into frogs and laughs. Water falls on her from above and she starts to melt.] Oh, no! Help! What's happening?
	Zoidberg	Uh, sorry. I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet.
	Bender	Wake up!
	Fry	Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
	Leela	I was having the most wonderful dream. [She points at Fry, Amy and Zoidberg.] Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there.
	Fry	Never mind, Professor. She came to.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh! So close.
	Hermes	There's always next year, Professor. There's always next year.
