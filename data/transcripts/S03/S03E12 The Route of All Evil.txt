	Bender	Ah, beer! So many choices, and it makes so little difference.
	Fry	How 'bout Löbrau? It has dots on it.
	Bender	Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
	Fry	I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
	Bender	Baby wants a Zima!
	Leela	Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now, listen, why don't we just brew our own beer?
	Bender	You can brew your own beer?
	Leela	Sure. The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.
	Hermes	Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son, suspended from boarding school.
	Dwight	It's not my fault, Dad.
	Professor Farnsworth	And you, Cubert! I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there.
	Cubert	Nuh-uh!
	Zoidberg	What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted-hearing-aid yelling?
	Hermes	I'm afraid it's both.
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] What?
	LaBarbara	Now hold on. Everyone, cool your daiquiris! Let's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves.
	Dwight	It was self defence, Mom. Just look at this letter the principal sent. [He puts the letter in a machine. Cubert's and Dwight's classroom appears on the TV.] We were in science class and we had just finished building a miniature black hole.
	Cubert	[on TV] That was easy.
	Bret	[on TV] Pretty scrawny black hole. It must be hungry.
	Cubert	[on TV] Duh! Black holes don't need food.
	Bret	[on TV] Neither do nerds!
	Dwight	[on TV] My Manwich!
	Cubert	[on TV] That's it, Bret. You've compressed our lunches to a singularity for the last time! Salt him, Dwight!
	Bret	[on TV] When I re-solidify, I'm gonna put you in a world of goop!
	Cubert	See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn so we used our brains!
	Professor Farnsworth	I've warned you not to use those things!
	Leela	Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in.
	Bender	Yo!
	Leela	Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
	Hermes	Dwight, you remember the crew.
	Dwight	[unenthusiastic] Eh.
	Professor Farnsworth	Crew, you remember Cubert? [The crew respond without enthusiasm.] Wonderful! Then I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!
	Cubert	Well, well. [He looks at Leela.] If it isn't my old friend, stretch pants ... [He looks at Bender.] ... no pants and ... [He looks at Fry.] ... idiot!
	Bender	We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
	Dwight	I heard alcohol makes you stupid.
	Fry	No I'm ... doesn't.
	Leela	Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good. So scram!
	Dwight	Aw, man!
	Cubert	I'm sick of this.
	Cubert	Hey, Dad. What useless contraption are you half-baking today?
	Professor Farnsworth	Eh, wha? Oh! This is my latest invention; a device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!
	Cubert	[Farnsworth's voice] Good news, everyone! I'm a horse's butt!
	Professor Farnsworth	I am? That's not good news at all, you little--
	Dwight	What's this devices marketability? Who's the target consumer?
	Professor Farnsworth	There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious, booming voice! [He speaks through the machine and there is feedback.] Now quit pestering me, you scoundrels!
	Hermes	[singing] Stamp it, file it. Oh, yeah! Send it overnight!
	Dwight	Can I collate that?
	Hermes	No!
	Cubert	Can I shred these contracts?
	Hermes	No!
	Dwight	Wow! A power-stamper!
	Hermes	Now look at all the work I gotta do! [He stamps "void" stamps over the others. He stamps his head.] Ow!
	Leela	Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
	Bender	Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? [crying] It's so beautiful.
	Leela	Talk to me.
	Professor Farnsworth	[on communicator] This is Professor Farnsworth. I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew. You must deliver a pizza to Dogdoo 8, a planet at the edge of the universe.
	Cubert	[Farnsworth's voice] Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing useless junk.
	Dwight	[Farnsworth's voice] And I smell bad.
	Cubert	Hey!
	Leela	If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to ... from your father ... when he got home from the Senate.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, bother! What have they done now?
	Bender	Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery.
	Fry	The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7.
	Hermes	Child man, is this true?
	Dwight	Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission.
	Cubert	[pointing at Bender] Plus, they're making bootleg beer inside company property!
	Bender	[shouting] Lies! Lies and slander!
	Professor Farnsworth	Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!
	Hermes	You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it.
	Bender	Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!
	Hermes	Get a job, you lazy kids!
	Bender	I guess if you want children beaten ... [He pulls out a blernsball bat.] ... you have to do it yourself.
	Cubert	Come on, Dad, shuffle faster!
	Dwight	You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company, do you?
	Hermes	Company? [He laughs.] How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?
	Professor Farnsworth	Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital!
	Cubert	Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company.
	Hermes	Welcome to the world of business!
	Professor Farnsworth	Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody, that's who!
	Dwight	But we already have a client signed up. We're delivering the Daily Supernova.
	Hermes	So your delivery company is just a cute, harmless paper route?
	Professor Farnsworth	Phew!
	Dwight	No! It's a serious business.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes it's a tremendous responsibility, alright! [He chuckles.] What if a paper were to land in a puddle?
	Hermes	Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!
	Dwight	Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile!
	Cubert	We'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft. [He shows Dwight an advert for a hovercraft.] Voilà! You got a quarter?
	Dwight	Man, the ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery.
	Cubert	More like seven!
	Bender	I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
	Fry	No, you have a healthy glow.
	Bender	Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!
	Leela	Ooh! Let me feel. [She and Fry sit next to Bender. She puts her ear to his chest.] Have you thought about what to name it?
	Bender	I was thinking "Benderbrau" if it's an ale, "Botweiser" if it's a lager.
	Fry	I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game. [Bender belches again. Leela giggles.] Ooh, I felt that one!
	Cubert	Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression.
	Dwight	Put a sticker on it.
	Hermes	Off on your first delivery, eh? You be careful, my little tinkler. [He pinches Dwight's cheek.] Remember we used to call you that, huh? Tinkler?
	Sal	Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts deliver themselveses! Only the Sunday edition can dos that.
	Professor Farnsworth	Goodness, there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50.
	Cubert	Yeah, if you're an idiot!
	Dwight	Three, two, one.
	Cubert	All systems go.
	Dwight	Blast-off!
	Hermes	[shouting] See you at din-din!
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] I'm blowing you a kiss.
	Cubert	Take evasive action!
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And ... gotcha!
	Cubert	[screaming] Nooo!
	Hermes	Business is down, so I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves.
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, well. If it isn't our little munchkin moguls!
	Hermes	What's the trouble, men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?
	Cubert	Actually, thanks to Dwight's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable brilliance ... [He snorts.] ... our paper route now has over a million customers!
	Dwight	We're finally making more money than you guys! Aren't you impressed now, Pops? Aren'tcha? Aren'tcha?
	Hermes	Uh, in a small way, yes. But you still don't have your own building or conference table or ... or one of those things!
	Zoidberg	Hello!
	Dwight	Our dads are never impressed, no matter what we do.
	Cubert	Maybe we should start a fire.
	Dwight	If we really wanna impress them we'll have to crush them with strategy ... Dwight Lightning!
	Cubert	Very well. But I get to name the next strategy.
	Announcer	[on TV] This week on The Real World: The Sun.
	Man	[on TV] I'm burning to death!
	Leela	You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
	Hermes	People, as you know, our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us.
	Bender	[simultaneous] Alright!
	Fry	[simultaneous] That's great!
	Leela	[simultaneous] That's good!
	Hermes	Naturally, we're humiliated.
	Professor Farnsworth	That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable.
	Hermes	We'll start by slashing salaries, and this time I mean really slashing.
	Leela	Uh, guys, I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly.
	Fry	We don't work for you anymore!
	Professor Farnsworth	What?
	Leela	Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
	Cubert	Incoming! We got papers to stuff, team! Hup two, hup two!
	Fry	Yes, sir.
	Bender	Right away!
	Leela	We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth.
	Professor Farnsworth	Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!
	Hermes	I don't even know who this guy is!
	Scruffy	I'm Scruffy, the janitor.
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express.
	Scruffy	I'm on break.
	Cubert	Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of activity but we have an announcement.
	Dwight	I direct your attention to these forms, which I'm presently engaged in handing to you.
	Hermes	Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!
	Professor Farnsworth	Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
	Dwight	No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge.
	Professor Farnsworth	Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap in a ditch at the park and they start declaring you this and that.
	Cubert	Either way, I technically inherit your building and your spaceship, which means Planet Express is now ... [He presses a button and an Awesome Express banner falls over the Planet Express logo on the screen.] ... Awesome Express!
	Hermes	[angry] You rotten kids! [nice] Will you be hiring?
	Dwight	No.
	Hermes	[angry] You rotten kids!
	Fry	There. One million papers, folded and loaded!
	Cubert	Hey, Leela, help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll make the ship go faster.
	Leela	And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
	Cubert	I'm 12.
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?
	Zoidberg	There but for the grace of God.
	Bender	[singing] Hush, little brewski,Don't you leak,Daddy wants to drink for at least a week.[He rumbles.] (talking) Oh, my God! I think it's time!
	Fry	Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs.
	Fry	Push, Bender, push!
	Leela	You're doing great!
	Bender	It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed outta me.
	Fry	Almost there. Just two more bottles.
	Bender	Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
	Fry	It's an ale! Five gallons, six ounces!
	Dwight	Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!
	Cubert	We just busted our bums delivering a million papers and this is how you greet us, with a bunch of frosty, cold beers?
	Fry	Hey, wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?
	Cubert	Uh ... we just did, OK? 'Cause we're awesome! Yeah! Awesome.
	Dwight	Yeah, awesome!
	Leela	Hello, Awesome Express; the rude, crude delivery dudes. How may I direct your call? What's that? You haven't gotten your paper? In how long?
	Professor Farnsworth	Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer? [LaBarbara scoffs.] Please?
	LaBarbara	Don't you sweet talk me, you wrinkly, old tube sack!
	Hermes	Might I have one too, wife?
	LaBarbara	Oh, you're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring. Now you should be happy they became successes, instead of following in your foot stamps.
	Hermes	Oh, it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years of being better than them.
	Professor Farnsworth	They're so stinking talented, they don't even need their fathers anymore.
	Cubert	Dad! We screwed up!
	Professor Farnsworth	You did? Tough luck, suckers!
	Dwight	Please, help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can handle.
	Cubert	[crying] But we couldn't handle them, so we started dumping the extras in a crater on the Moon.
	Dwight	[crying] And now everyone's yelling at us about our missing papers!
	Cubert	[crying] And we don't know what to do!
	Professor Farnsworth	Why did you boys do all this?
	Dwight	[crying] We just wanted you to be proud of us.
	Hermes	Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard for human decency. Of course we're proud of you!
	Professor Farnsworth	Damn right we are! Now come on, let's go do a little father-son weaselling out of this.
	Professor Farnsworth	[from ship] Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes.
	Hermes	OK, boys, let me show you how a paper man does it.
	Little Prince	Au revoir!
	Dwight	Can I use the gun, Dad?
	Hermes	Aw, what kind of father would I be if I said no?
	Dwight	Only one house to go. We did it! [They cheer. The screen beeps and displays the Blob house. Inside, Bret Blob lifts weights.] Run away! That bully, Bret Blob, lives there!
	Cubert	He's ugly mean stupid stink mucus! And last week we sort of ... broke his window.
	Hermes	Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?
	Dwight	[sheepish] Pay for it?
	Hermes	Oh, heavens, no! We apologise, with nice, cheap words!
	Bret	I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell!
	Dwight	Man, you're funny. Good one, Bret.
	Professor Farnsworth	Now, now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy.
	Bret	Whatever. [shouting] Dad!
	Hermes	Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal, reasonable man.
	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	What the hell do you want?
	Professor Farnsworth	Mr. Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends.
	Cubert	Sorry, sir.
	Dwight	Yeah, sorry.
	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	You can shove your apology into the bottom of your one-way digestive system.
	Professor Farnsworth	Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	Aww. Tell you what, I'll accept their apology when they kiss my ass! Which I don't have!
	Professor Farnsworth	No one gives my boy that option!
	Hermes	Bring it on, Jello-pop!
	Cubert	Yeah, get him, Dad!
	Dwight	Show 'em who's boss! [Horrible Gelatinous Blob grabs Farnsworth and Hermes and smacks them around. Then some more.] Get 'em ... Pops!
	Cubert	Right.
	Cubert	That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma centre!
	Dwight	You guys almost had him ... until he digested you.
	Hermes	Oh, you're good kids. [He coughs.] If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride. [Cubert and Dwight hug their dads, making them scream.] I was wrong! I can still feel pain!
	Professor Farnsworth	He's come to finish the job! Someone toss me out the window!
	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	No, no, wait. I-I feel terrible about what happened. I-I've just been under a lot of stress lately down at the plant, y'know. They're-They're bringing in computers to "improve productivity" and, well, that's no excuse for how I acted. But the boy needs to see that real men solve their disagreements with words, not violence, so, uh, if you'll accept my apology, well, I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us.
	Professor Farnsworth	I suppose.
	Bender	Hey, chumps, I heard you were on the ass-end of an ass-kicking so I figured you could use a couple these little babies.
	Hermes	Oh, why not? Might as well live it up as long as I've got this catheter in me!
	Professor Farnsworth	Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?
	Horrible Gelatinous Blob	Sounds like a plan!
	Hermes	This is what makes life worth clinging to; three fathers enjoying a day out with their sons.
	Professor Farnsworth	It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life: Man or Blob, it's what's inside that counts.
