	Man	Yes! Good thing I noticed the similar shapes.
	Hermes	[from behind curtain] Planet Express stockholders, I present our chief executive officer, Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh!
	Amy	There he is!
	Hattie	[shouting] Take it off!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Where am I?
	Hermes	Move forward. Walk into the light.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, God, I'm dead! Well, no matter. [He takes some cards out of his coat and walks under the spotlight to the lectern.] [reading] Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now, without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year.
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] Planet Express is on the move. For this hip, young delivery company, tomorrow is today and today is yesterday. You heard me. [The ship zooms off and the scene cuts to Fry handing a package to Kug.] It was a year of soaring profits and significant one-time losses.
	Fry	[whispering] Psst! Watching myself work is making me hungry. Help me find some food somewhere.
	Zoidberg	I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!
	Fry	Ooh! A Bot Mitzvah. Shalom, hunger! Shalom, free food!
	Robot #1	No shellfish!
	Zoidberg	That is so unfair!
	Pig	Tell me about it.
	Fry	So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
	Rabbi-bot	We believe he was built and that he was a very well programmed robot. But he wasn't our Messiah.
	Narrator	[voice-over; in movie] And so our company flames onwards. Planet Express: Limitless potential, boundless horizons, the unstoppable juggernaut of the corporate universe.
	Hermes	It's been a terrible year, people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
	Leela	But the movie--
	Hermes	Was a substantial loss for the company. [A pie chart appears on the screen showing a large green slice and a small blue slice.] The blue slice represents the money we earned from shipping packages, while the green slice represents an $8 bank error in our favour.
	Leela	This toads the wet sprocket. What about out thousands of shares of stock?
	Hermes	Worthless.
	Bender	[shouting] I'll kill you!
	Hattie	I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 1: Why does no one visit me in my home?
	Prof. Farnsworth	'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.
	Fry	This is perfect for me.
	Zoidberg	Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free-- [The man slams the door in his face.] You didn't let me finish. I was going to say "to get the free food".
	Joe	My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
	ALL	[monotonous] Hello, Joe.
	Joe	When I was frozen, giant carrots ruled the Earth, but now they don't. It takes some getting used to.
	Steve Castle	Back in the 1980's, I was the toast of Wall Street. I was having whiskey with Boesky and cookies with Milken. But then, I was diagnosed with terminal boneitis.
	Fry	Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
	Steve Castle	There was no cure at the time. One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold off all the assets. Made a cool hundred mil. [He laughs and coughs. The group applauds.] Naturally I froze myself until a cure was found. Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way back to the top, 80's style!
	Caveman	As a caveman frozen in a glacier, I face different challenges. [crying] The hardest thing was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum.
	Fry	[whispering] Hey, buddy, I'm from the same time as you. Remember that song, Safety Dance?
	Steve Castle	Sure do! We can dance!
	Fry	Y'know, that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
	Steve Castle	I tell you: Two go-go 80's Reagan-auts like us, we could rule this world!
	Fry	No question!
	Steve Castle	If only someone would give us a shot.
	Fry	They're scared of our raw power. Oh, but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work.
	Steve Castle	Awesome. Awesome to the max!
	Hermes	And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only.
	Bender	Aw, come on! I've got a lot of ransom notes to send!
	Hattie	Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment to snuggle my cat.
	Scruffy	Second.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
	Scruffy	Second.
	Hattie	I move that we vote on a new chief executive officer and oust this old creep. And also that make cat smells good and is pretty.
	Scruffy	Second.
	Hermes	Very well. I nominate the Professor.
	Amy	Second.
	Leela	Second.
	Bender	Second.
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'm your man.
	Leela	I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.
	Hermes	Yeah, the Professor!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Me!
	Fry	I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie. [Everyone mutters. Fry pulls out a crumpled piece of paper from his jacket.] My shares still count if they went through the washing machine, right?
	Hermes	Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd say that--
	Scruffy	Now hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger.
	Leela	40,000? How come you have four-times as much stock as the rest of us?
	Scruffy	Scruffy believes in this company.
	Hermes	Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie, the Professor, as the current CEO remains--
	Hattie	I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone. And I'm voting against the cat-hater. [She pulls a cat out of her handbag.] Isn't that right, kitty? [The cat meows.] Hey! You ate my change!
	Hermes	Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy.
	Hermes	Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy.
	Steve Castle	Let's cut to the chase. There are two kinds of people: Sheep and sharks. Anyone who's a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?
	Zoidberg	Uh, excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?
	Steve Castle	Gutsy question. You're a shark. Sharks are winners and they don't look back 'cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep. [Everyone sinks down and covers their necks.] I am proud to be the shepherd of this herd of sharks and I am gonna lead you to the top in this industry of ... of--
	Fry	[whispering] Package delivery.
	Steve Castle	Package delivery? Oh, God! [He covers his face.] Fantastic! Now, the first order of business is to blame everything on the guy before me. Professor?
	Prof. Farnsworth	I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
	Steve Castle	Terrific. Question number one: What was your overall business plan?
	Prof. Farnsworth	Um, business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here, right next to my heart.
	Steve Castle	This isn't a business plan, it's an escape plan.
	Prof. Farnsworth	So long, suckers!
	Steve Castle	Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar-jockey, I'm making you my new vice chairman.
	Fry	I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
	Zoidberg	It's the end of the line!
	Hermes	We're ruined!
	Scruffy	What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?
	Monster	Thank you, come again!
	Steve Castle	That's what I call a hostile makeover! Hair gel?
	Fry	No, thanks. I make my own.
	Steve Castle	This company's gonna shoot straight to the top and stay there, like Cindy Lauper! I ask you: Who is the number one delivery service on Earth?
	Zoidberg	Is it Planet Express, master?
	Steve Castle	Is this guy a shark, or what? Seriously though, we stink out loud. Here's the big enchirito. [He opens the blind revealing Mom's building. The sign on the top of the building shows Mom bottle-feeding a parcel like a baby.] Mom's Friendly Delivery Company.
	Hermes	We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil. Ours is small and neutral.
	Steve Castle	Switzerland is small and neutral. We're more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood.
	Amy	Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength of will?
	Steve Castle	I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves get beaten by an old lady?
	Zoidberg	Yes, my liege!
	Fry	No, we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. [He pulls his trousers down and moons Mom.] Look at my butt!
	Mom	You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button.
	Walt	Uh ... um ... hmm ... let's see.
	Mom	[shouting] Any button! They all retaliate!
	Fry	Woo! Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him! [He laughs.] Now this is the high life; watching apes mangle each other near celebrities.
	Steve Castle	In my day we went to coke parties but the principle's the same.
	Calculon	Get your stinkin' trike off me, you damn dirty ape.
	Steve Castle	Listen, big guy, now that you're my protégé, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?
	Fry	Uh, work really, really hard?
	Steve Castle	No.
	Fry	Oh, thank God!
	Steve Castle	It's all about appearances. That's why it's time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980's!
	Fry	This company's on the fast track to the "It" list. Blast back kudos all around!
	Leela	Uh, hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
	Steve Castle	Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business. Image, people, image! Scope out this new ad!
	Mom	[on screen; in movie] We are all one, with one mind, one purpose and one act. Our enemies shall be eaten by squirrels. [The delivery woman starts spinning around.] We shall bow down and worship to ourselves. [The woman hurls the package at the screen.] We shall prevail!
	Man	[in movie] Hey! We were watching that!
	Leela	That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
	Bender	I don't even know what we do. Nah, just kidding! What are, like, a bus or something?
	Leela	Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?
	Fry	Yes I did, Leels. And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
	Leela	Oh, Lord!
	Zoidberg	This company's circling the drain, I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sangwich!
	Steve Castle	Sold!
	Zoidberg	A complete sangwich? [He laughs.] You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!
	Mom	What is this moose drip? [She opens the magazines and holograms of Fry and Steve Castle wearing crowns appear under the headline "The New Delivery Kings?".] [reading] The new delivery kings? [talking] I'm sick of hearing about those turtle squirts!
	Igner	But they're kings, Mommy!
	Mom	Jam a bastard in it, you crap!
	Elzar	Enjoy our private dining room, folks. This is where we serve our richest, most successful chumps!
	Fry	Tonight, that's us!
	Steve Castle	What have you got that's really overpriced?
	Elzar	Everything.
	Steve Castle	Bring me that.
	Fry	Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
	Steve Castle	OK, let's work on your execu-speak. I'm worried about "blank".
	Fry	Don't you worry about "blank". Let me worry about "blank".
	Steve Castle	Good. I also would have accepted, "Blank? Blank? You're not looking at the big picture!"
	Fry	[weakly] What a pleasant surprise!
	Mom	Shut up, booger blaster! It's time the three of us had a talk.
	Steve Castle	I'll handle this, Fry. You get back to the farm, shift some paradigms, revolutionise outside the box.
	Fry	I'm on it. But if you need me, you know where I'll be.
	Fry	[muttering] Call me a "booger blaster"! I'll blast a booger so hard that--
	Leela	Fry, we're worried about Planet Express.
	Fry	Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about "blank".
	Hermes	That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised by his swinging baloney!
	Leela	You've changed, Fry.
	Fry	What? I haven't changed. [He presses his intercom.] Suz? Have I changed?
	Suz	[on intercom] No, sir, Mr. Fry.
	Fry	Thanks, doll.
	Leela	I don't care what Ms. Johnson says. That Guy's turning this place into some kind of business.
	Prof. Farnsworth	This isn't a business. I've always thought of it more of a source of cheap labour, like a family.
	Fry	You're right, Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street. But we are a family and That Guy understands that.
	Steve Castle	[on screen] Everyone's fired and we're out of business.
	Amy	Oh, no!
	Hermes	How?
	Steve Castle	[on screen] I'm gonna sell Planet Express to Mom so she can gut the company and eliminate us as competitors.
	Mom	[on screen] Don't let the door hit you on the way out, 'cause I don't want ass prints on my new door!
	Fry	Uh, Ms. Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.
	Fry	I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck-up. You've gotta believe me!
	Leela	Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
	Bender	Yeah!
	Amy	[crying] It's so sad, where will I go? What will I do?
	Lackey	You have Mrs. Darlinghaven's cotillion at 7, ma'am.
	Amy	[crying] Oh. That'll be fun.
	Fry	Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?
	Suz	[on intercom] I don't know, sir. I'm a program built into the intercom.
	Fry	I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!
	Suz	[on intercom] Mr. Fry, your two o'clock magician is here.
	Fry	Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands. [He gets his hat and coat then hesitates.] Reschedule.
	Broker-bot #1	[shouting] Sell 100 soylent beans!
	Broker-bot #2	[shouting] Buy 3,000 cornbellies!
	Broker-bot #3	[shouting] 200 canned whoop-ass!
	Broker-bot #1	[shouting] Three big bags of trash!
	Jor-El	Attention, please. The takeover of PlanEx Corp. by Mom's Delivery Company will take place in the business centre in 10 minutes. I am Jor-El, master of scheduling!
	Steve Castle	OK. We've got the hot tub hot, the wine cooler's cool. It's Hammer time!
	Bender	You suck!
	Mom	According to regulations, both companies must approve the takeover. Planet Express shareholders, cast your votes.
	Hermes	Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!
	Bender	I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
	Bender	What the--?
	Hattie	How the--?
	Amy	Oh, no!
	Steve Castle	I neglected to mention that the shares I bought from Dr. Zoidberg gave me majority control.
	Leela	Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
	Hermes	The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper.
	Mom	And now if Momcorp shareholders will cast their ballots.
	Igner	Um ... uh... [He votes and a new total for "Pat Buchanan" appears. Larry and Walt glare at him.] Uh, the ballot was confusing.
	Mom	How about a hand recount?
	Igner	OK. [She slaps him.] Ow!
	Mom	The takeover of Planet Express is approved.
	Amy	This stinks!
	Lackey	Madam is outraged.
	Steve Castle	Security, I want that bunch of rowdies outta here.
	Bender	Hold on a minute!
	Scruffy	Hey! Hey!
	Mom	Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding shares of Planet Express at the current market price, which is:
	Jor-El	107.
	Bender	Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
	Horrible Gelatinous Stockbroker	What are you solids griping about? Your shares are worth $107 apiece.
	Leela	They are? Oh, my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!
	Bender	Yeah! Alright!
	Amy	I'm even richer!
	Zoidberg	Oh! I have no shares! [He cries.] Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value? [His sandwich has turned green.] Please, oh, please!
	Hermes	You didn't even refrigerate it, you spineless lobster!
	Zoidberg	You had to drag spines into this!
	Fry	[on screen] As vice chairman of Planet Express, I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now.
	Fry	So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?
	Steve Castle	Fry, I'm an 80's guy. Friendship to me means that for two bucks I'd beat you with a pool cue till you got detached retinas. The deal will go ahead as-- [His fingers and jaw suddenly twist. He screams. He falls to the floor and his bones crack and twist.] My bones!
	Fry	Oh, my God! His boneitis!
	Steve Castle	I was so busy being an 80's guy, I forgot to cure it. [He twists some more.] My only regret is ... that I have ... boneitis!
	Fry	He's dead.
	Mom	Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and let's get on with the sale.
	Fry	I don't think so. 'Cause, as vice chairman of the company, I gain voting control of his shares.
	Mom	Don't be a fool, you idiot!
	Fry	I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived. And before his mysterious death, he taught me everything he knew. [The stock price changes to 114.] But some things I had to learn myself. [It changes to 99.] I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people ... [57.] ... people you love. [46.] You can't put a price on that. [28.] So I'm giving up control of the company ... [107.] ... to a man of enormous experience ... [115.] ... Professor ... [150.] ... Hubert Farnsworth.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Oh, uh, what? I'm awake, I'm awake!
	Bender	Fry! Stop doing the right thing, you jerk!
	Leela	Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy, stinking rich!
	Zoidberg	Trust me, two out of three doesn't cut it!
	Fry	You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
	Leela	Hell, yeah!
	Fry	In my whole life, this company was the only place I'd ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our--
	Bender	It is!
	Fry	Friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you.
	Hattie	"Millionaires" nothing! The stock's only worth three kajiggers!
	Bender	Oh, come on!
	Hermes	My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!
	Fry	It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
	Zoidberg	Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor! [He eats the sandwich.] Oh! I'm ruined. [He cries.] Why? Why?
	Fry	Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together.
	Bender	Shut your fat mouth!
	Fry	[shouting] See you guys Monday!
