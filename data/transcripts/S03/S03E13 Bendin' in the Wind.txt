	Bender	[singing] Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huhWell, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride,Blah, blah, blah, something, Bender is great!Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh--
	Fry	Oh, my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time! [He opens the packet and Bender eats one. Something clangs around inside of him and he shits a brick. Then some.] There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
	Bender	What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
	Fry	No, it's an old Volkswagen van. [He wipes the window clean and sees some hippie skeletons inside.] [shouting] Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?
	Sal	[shouting] Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses.
	Fry	Yeah, yeah, I've gotten used cars before.
	Leela	What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
	Fry	It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!
	Amy	Wow, neat.
	Hermes	It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.
	Amy	Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?
	Fry	No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
	Fry	Under the seat.
	Leela	Why won't it start?
	Fry	It just needs some gas.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.
	Leela	Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.
	Fry	Like what?
	Leela	Whale oil. [She points to a barrel of Mobil Dick Whale Oil.] Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
	Bender	Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off.
	Fry	Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs.
	Bender	What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
	Fry	Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that.
	Bender	OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.
	Leela	Come on!
	Hermes	You can do it!
	Amy	Bender!
	Prof. Farnsworth	Go on, you dummy.
	Bender	[singing] Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,[He screams in pain.]Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
	Fry	Oh, no!
	Bender	[singing] Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,Cause the master's gone away.
	Zoidberg	[tapping his feet] It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
	Bender	Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?
	Doctor	This is the worst part of the job.
	Bender	What is it, good news?
	Doctor	Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again.
	Bender	You mean--
	Doctor	I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one.
	Fry	Oh, no! This is terrible.
	Zoidberg	Poor Bender.
	Prof. Farnsworth	Well, let's drag him to the kerb.
	Fry	Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes.
	Bender	[crying] Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.
	Robot	Ho, ho! Hello there!
	Leela	Look, Bender! It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter.
	Patch Cord Adams	Come on, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?
	Bender	Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.
	Patch Cord Adams	Hey, here's a giggle! [He plugs himself into a Jokebook Computer and downloads some jokes.] Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?
	Fry	No, why?
	Patch Cord Adams	'Cause it always locks up.
	Bender	For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!
	Patch Cord Adams	Well, so long. Get well soon. [He looks at Bender's medical notes.] Oh, well, so long anyway.
	Bender	Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way.
	Fry	Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?
	Bender	Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up. [The doctor draws back the curtain and reveals the head in a jar of Beck. Beck wears a futuristic harmonica holder around his neck with little arms that move the harmonica back and forth in front of his mouth. The doctor pulls a mask over his face and welds Beck's jar to the neck of a life-sized dummy. Beck stops playing.] Wow, that was great.
	Beck	Hey, thanks. You a fan?
	Bender	I dunno. Let me see. [He focuses his eyes and sees Beck's nameplate.] Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.
	Beck	Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this mannequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.
	Bender	Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you.
	Beck	So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks.
	Bender	Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.
	Beck	Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
	Bender	What's this for?
	Beck	Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast. [Bender struggles and strains as he tries to move the little arms on the harmonica holder.] Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic. [Bender starts moving the arms with ease and scrapes them across his scarred chest.] Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations, my friend.
	Bender	Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
	Beck	Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player.
	Bender	Alright! [He does a happy dance with the little arms.] Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
	Bender	Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues.
	Hermes	Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true.
	Fry	Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?
	Zoidberg	Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van.
	Beck	[shouting] Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait for it at the start.
	Zoidberg	Bad news, friends. My shell ran.
	Amy	Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's--
	Leela	Kinda cool.
	Fry	Yeah, I like it.
	Amy	Me too, now that I'm used to it.
	Zoidberg	Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that!
	Beck	[singing] There's a destination a little up the road,From the habitations and the towns we know,A place we saw the lights turn low,The jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh glow,Pullin' out jives and jamboree handouts,Two turntables and a microphone,Bottles and cans just clap your hands,Just clap your hands.
	ALL	[singing] Where it's at!
	Bender	[electric voice] Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
	Beck	That was a washboard break.
	Fry	Oh, yeah!
	Amy	Yeah! [She turns around to the bar.] One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please.
	Barman	That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington.
	Amy	Oh, no! My beautiful money.
	Leela	It got ruined in the wash.
	Fry	Mine too, even my change.
	Barman	Get lost, you money-less hippies!
	Horrible Gelatinous Hick	You heard him, freaks. We don't like your type around here. These are the types we like.
	Beck	Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind.
	Bender	Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!
	Robot #1	I don't believe my broken eyes! It's Bender, the washboard player! Hey, man, we caught your concert from here.
	Robot #2	You rock!
	Fembot	Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest! It's in that bin behind me.
	Robot #3	Yo, brother, thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful.
	Bender	Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be-- [He is interrupted by the sound of machinery in a building grinding up the robots and turning them into paperweights.] That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass.
	Beck	Whoa, dog. Just cold chill. [A woman moves him closer to Bender.] You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really-- What's that song about?
	Bender	Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like "odelay".
	Beck	"Odelay" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary.
	Bender	Ooh!
	Bender	I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary. [A man offers him the book.] No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.
	Beck	I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds.
	Bender	Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!
	Beck	We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
	Bender	And we could call it "Bend-Aid", after me, Bender!
	Beck	And you can sing that song you're writing!
	Bender	And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.
	Bender	Alright. "Hands in the air" rhymes with "Just don't care" and ... finished! [He sniffs.] Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!
	Fry	Surprise!
	Leela	Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
	Bender	Alright, but hands off the minibar.
	Fry	Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on.
	Announcer #1	[voice-over; on TV] Tuesday, Golden Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely-folkish alterna-rock will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing Fungus and special guest, Bender!
	Announcer #2	[voice-over; on TV] A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots.
	Fry	Yeah!
	Zoidberg	Hooray, robot!
	Amy	Bender, you're famous!
	Bender	Yeah.
	Leela	This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?
	Bender	[crying] Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now: I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobilised. [He stops crying and stands up.] That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, "Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!".
	Fry	Bender, you can move! You're cured!
	Bender	Oh, crap! It's a miracle!
	Bender	I can move again. [crying] My music career is over.
	Fry	Bender, I don't claim to understand "the biz" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?
	Bender	[crying] No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish. [He gasps and stops crying.] Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!
	Amy	You'd better not do that at the concert.
	Zoidberg	I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat.
	Amy	You are so disgusting, I--
	Leela	They're beautiful.
	Zoidberg	Ew, you're touching them!
	Amy	I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing.
	Zoidberg	I am? At last! Recognition!
	Emcee	[on loudspeaker] Gentle hippies, put your filthy hands together for the folk stylings of Cylon and Garfunkel!
	Garfunkel	Here's a song that was beautiful when performed by my ancestor, Art.(singing) Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
	Cylon	and [singing] Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
	Garfunkel	[singing] Remember me to one who loves there.
	Cylon	and [singing] She once was a true love of mine.
	Leela	We're home.
	Amy	Well, let's earn some bread.
	Fry	Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!
	Hippie #1	Wow, look at the colours. These'll go great with my soul.
	Zoidberg	Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently.
	Hippie #2	I'll take three.
	Hippie #3	Give me one, man!
	Hippie #4	I'll trade you a bad poem!
	Emcee	[on loudspeaker] And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for ... Beck! With special guest, Bender, the broken robot.
	Fry	[shouting] Bender rules!
	Hippie #5	Groove on, man!
	Leela	Rock it, Bender!
	Zoidberg	Play that thing!
	Beck	[singing] Can't you hear those cavalry drums,Hijacking your equilibrium...
	Bender	Whoa-oh, yeah!
	Beck	[singing] ...Midnight hags in the mausoleum,
	Beck	Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into a serious thing ... and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business before we go.
	Garfunkel	Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big, cardboard cheque for $14,000.
	Cylon	It's been an emotional day for me.
	Bender	[crying] I don't know what to say.
	Beck	Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down, boys.
	Bender	Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery ... [The broken robots cheer.] ... this is a song called My Broken Friend.[The crowd cheer.](singing) People say my broken friend is useless,But I say his mind is free,There's lots of things my mangled robot friend could be,
	Beck	Kick it!
	Bender	[singing] He could make a good...
	Bender	and [singing] ...hat-rack
	Beck	[singing] He only has to stand there,
	Bender	[singing] Or a cheap...
	Bender	and [singing] ...doorstop,
	Beck	[singing] He doesn't need to move
	Bender	[singing] Or a great big...
	Bender	and [singing] ...giant Thermos,
	Bender	[singing] With a twist-off top,
	Beck	[singing] That would be good for soup,
	Bender	[singing] He could be a storage closet...
	Bender	and [singing] ...for outdated pants,
	Beck	I like 'em tight!
	Bender	[singing] My broken friend could do it all,
	Bender	and [singing] Just give him a chance!
	Bender	[singing] That robot has a tragic secret,That I'd like to share...
	Beck	For real?
	Bender	[singing] ...My broken friend is closer to me,Than an ass to a chair...
	Beck	Hm.
	Bender	[singing] ...That robot's name I never told you...
	Beck	Who's that?
	Bender	[singing] ...You could not foresee...
	Beck	C'mon, give it up.
	Bender	[singing] ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
	Bender	and [singing] His name is you and me.
	Bender	[singing] Don't melt me down into a crowbar,
	Beck	[singing] It suffers alone,
	Bender	[singing] Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,
	Beck	Hey.
	Bender	[singing] Or toss me into a trash can...
	Beck	Bender, what are you doing?
	Bender	[singing] ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
	Beck	What are you doing?
	Bender	[singing] ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
	Beck	Yo! What's the dealy-o?
	Bender	[singing] ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
	Beck	Hold it! What? No!
	Bender	[singing] ...I'm telling you, my broken friend...
	Beck	B-Bender.
	Bender	[singing] ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
	Beck	No!
	Bender	[singing] I'm telling you, my broken friend...
	Beck	Cut it!
	Bender	[singing] ...Can do 'most anything!
	Beck	Cut it!
	Bender	Yeah!
	Beck	Cut it!
	Bender	Curse my natural showmanship!
	Robot #4	[shouting] You big, fat fraud! You're not really broken!
	Robot #5	[shouting] But you will be in a minute! Bum-rush the stage!
	Robot #6	Get him!
	Hippie #6	Oh, harsh! I didn't get my beads.
	Beck	You, minion, lift up my arm. [A stage hand points his arm forwards.] After him!
	Bender	Well, everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers.
	Caterpillar Alien	What is this? The Year of the Jerk?
	Fry	Hurry! The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal.
	Bender	Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge.
	Leela	And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
	Fry	Is any of that a problem?
	Zoidberg	Not if you've lived a life without regret.
	Bender	I'll save me!
	Leela	Quick, grab his footcups.
	Bender	Hey? What? No.
	Fry	Phew!
	Leela	Bummer.
	Bender	[shouting] Someone fat get in my way! [He lands on the thin woman and squashes her. He gets up and staggers away. Beck's bus rams him and knocks him over. Beck, Cylon and Garfunkel get out. Bender groans.] [talking] I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me.
	Beck	Good.
	Bender	I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone.
	Beck	Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horse crap-- But I know you don't mean it so apology accepted.
	Bender	So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?
	Garfunkel	Over my dead career!
	Bender	Well, it was worth a shot.
	Fry	[shouting] C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home.
	Bender	Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.[He takes a magnet from Ye Olde Tourist Trappe and puts it on his head. His pupils go wild and he starts to sing.]Fry cracked corn,And I don't care,Leela cracked corn,I still don't care,Bender cracked corn,And he is great!Take that, you stupid corn!
