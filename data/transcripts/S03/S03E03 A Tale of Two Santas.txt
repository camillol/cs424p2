	Linda	[on TV] In what has become a winter tradition, members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club today took the plunge into a river of liquid ammonia.
	Morbo	[on TV] There were no survivors.
	Linda	[on TV] Takes all kinds! And now, with his annual Xmas message, here's the head of the Xmas Safety Council, the head of Walter Cronkite.
	Walter Cronkite	[on TV] Season's warnings, Linda and Morbo.
	Bender	This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
	Cronkite	[on TV] In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season we too often underestimate that murderous brute better known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's gingerbread massacre freshly baked into our memories, I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye to your pets and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying, "I told you so".
	Hermes	Sacred boa of West and Eastern Samoa. We've got to secure for Santa's arrival.
	Fry	Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.
	Professor Farnsworth	Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna spend them dead.
	Leela	We're pushing as hard as we can.
	Bender	Oh, pushing!
	Professor Farnsworth	Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed.
	Professor Farnsworth	Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building.
	Fry	[cheering] Alright!
	Leela	[cheering] Yeah!
	Professor Farnsworth	In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune.
	Fry	These letters are real butt-nutters! [He opens one.] Listen to this one: [reading] Dear Santa.
	Girl	[voice-over; writing] Please, please don't bring me any gifts. The bicycle you fired at me last year from your bicycle gun really tore up my insides.
	Leela	Awful! Let's read some more. [reading] Dear Santa.
	Boy	[voice-over; writing] Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked him with a chestnut last year and he's beginning to smell a lot like Xmas if you know what I mean.
	Fry	It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!
	Bender	Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!
	Fry	Certainly yes us, uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember.
	Leela	Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!
	Leela	Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party.
	Aide #1	Hey! Wanna buy a tiny little kidney?
	Aide #2	I'll let you punch me for a buck.
	Fry	Uh, look; we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?
	Aide #2	We're not elves. We're Neptunians.
	Aide #1	We're just shrimp-y because he doesn't feed us.
	Aide #2	You hit me! You owe me a dollar.
	Aide #3	Hey, you got any food? Old teabags, chewed gum, apple cores? Come on! We're starving here!
	Fry	But you live in a gingerbread house.
	Aide #4	Hey! It's food or shelter, not both.
	Bender	You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
	Aide #4	Who said "toys"?
	Neptunians	Toys? Toys? Who said "toys"?
	Aide #2	False alarm, folks! There's no reason to make toys since Santa judges everyone to be naughty.
	Fry	That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?
	Aide #2	There! In his ice fortress.
	Leela	We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?
	Aide #1	I'll help you!
	Aide #2	Ah, phooey!
	Aide #2	An omen?
	Aide #1	Dinner!
	Santa	Let's see who's been naughty, and who's been naughty! [He pushes a button and Clamps and Joey Mouse Pad appear on the screen, beating a man. The man screams in pain.] Mobsters beating up a shopkeeper for protection money. Very naughty! [He writes.] Shopkeeper's not paying their protection money. Exactly as naughty! [He presses another button and Scruffy appears sitting on some steps. He rubs his nose.] I saw that! [He writes. A squeaking comes from behind him.] Huh?
	Aide #2	We brought your mail.
	Santa	Don't you ever knock? Who knows what naughty things I could be watching? I get New Orleans on this thing, you know!
	Aide #2	Don't kill us!
	Leela	Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears.
	Santa	Holy night! Intruders!
	Leela	Hold it, Santa! [She nods at Bender who covers his ears and sings to himself.] Consider this: You are programmed to destroy the naughty, but many of those you destroy are in fact nice. I submit to you that you are naughty and, logically, you must destroy yourself.
	Santa	Nice try. But my head was built with paradox-absorbing crumple-zones.
	Leela	Wait! This is what we're running from!
	Fry	Faster! Faster!
	Fry	Why aren't we moving?
	Leela	I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.
	Santa	Ho, ho-- Eh?
	Fry	He's trapped!
	Aide #2	Now we can make toys again!
	Neptunians	[chanting] Toys! Toys! Toys!
	Fry	And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.
	Santa	Ha! No human could do all that.
	Fry	Evil Knievel could!
	Santa	Nuh-uh!
	Bender	Santa's right. We need some sort of robot. [There is silence. The Neptunians, Santa, Fry and Leela stare at Bender.] Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot.
	Neptunians	Hooray! [They throw their clothes in the air.] Hooray! [They throw their underwear in the air.] Hooray!
	Santa	Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications.
	Bender	Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either. [He pulls it out of his coat.] But that didn't stop me.
	Leela	Bender!
	Bender	Bow to your new Santa!
	Neptunians	Our hero!
	Neptunians	[singing] We are free and fairly sober,With so many toys to build.
	Neptunians	[singing] The machines are kinda tricky,Probably someone will be killed,But we gladly work for nothing--
	Fry	[singing] Which is good because we don't intend to pay.
	All	[singing] The elves are back to work today!
	Neptunians	[singing] Hooray![They saw logs and they go down a conveyor belt.]We have just a couple hours,To make several billion gifts,[A Neptunian boxes some toys. Another adds the polystyrene S's.]And the labour isn't easy--
	Leela	[singing] Then you'll all work triple shifts,You can make the job go quicker if you turn up the controls to super-speed.
	Fry	, and [singing] It's back to work on Xmas Eve!
	Neptunians	[cheering] Hooray!
	Leela	[singing] And though you're cold and sore and ugly,Your pride will mask the pain.
	Fry	[singing] Let my happy smile warm your hearts--
	Aide #5	[singing] There's a toy lodged in my brain!
	Neptunians	[singing] We are getting awfully tired,And we can't work any faster,And we're very, very sorry--
	Bender	[singing] Why you selfish little bastards,Do you want the kids to think that Santa's just a crummy, empty-handed jerk?
	Aide #6	Ow!
	Bender	[singing] Then shut your yaps and back to work.
	Neptunians	[singing] Now it's very nearly Xmas,And we've done the best we could,
	Fry	[singing] These toys soldiers are poorly painted.
	Leela	[singing] And they're made from inferior wood.
	Bender	[singing] I should give you all a beating,But I really have to fly.
	Santa	[singing] If I weren't stuck here frozen,I'd harpoon you in the eye.
	Neptunians	[singing] Now it's back into our tenements,To drown ourselves in rye.
	Leela	[singing] You did the best you could,I guess that some of these gorillas are OK.
	Aide #7	We're adequate!
	All	[singing] The elves have rescued Xmas Day! Hooray!
	Bender	[stupid voice] Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars? [normal voice] I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them? [stupid voice] Duh, OK!
	Girl	Mommy! Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!
	Mrs. Grant	This is it, kids. Take your suicide pills so you won't suffer.
	Bender	No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!
	Jeffery	Don't listen to him. He's the father of all lies and the uncle of all tricks!
	Bender	But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
	Mrs. Grant	Go for the shins!
	Bender	[groaning] One down...
	Petunia	Well, hello there, handsome! [She opens a cookie jar.] Won't you have a cookie?
	Bender	Uh, don't mind if I do. [He reaches in and a mousetrap snaps on his fingers.] Ow! What's in these things?
	Petunia	Why don't you slip into something more fiery?
	Bender	Ow!
	Kwanzaabot	Yo, Kringle! What happened to you, doll?
	Bender	Oh, it's awful, Kwanzaabot. Everyone hates me.
	Kwanzaabot	At least they understand you, you know what I'm sayin'? Ain't nobody down with this Kwanzaa tip.
	Bender	Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
	Kwanzaabot	No time! I gotta hand out the traditional Kwanzaa book. [He holds up a book called "What The Hell Is Kwanzaa?" and sighs.] I've been givin' these out for 647 years!
	Fry	Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink. [He tastes it and spits it out.] Ew! It went sour!
	Zoidberg	Can't I have a scented bath in peace?
	Leela	Remember, Professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!
	Bender	Ho, ho-- [Farnsworth blasts Bender in the chest with a shotgun and he falls back.] Ow!
	Leela	[shouting] Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
	Professor Farnsworth	[shouting] No!
	Bender	[crying] Oh, there's gotta be a better way.
	Bender	Bender, you're a genius!
	Vyolet	This creates an unrealistic standard of beauty!
	Bender	Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
	Smitty	It's Santa! And we got him cornered!
	URL	Aw, I smell a juicy promotion for me.
	Smitty	And a juicy re-hiring-back-onto-the-force for me!
	Bailiff	This Xmas Day session of court will come to order. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
	Whitey	Santa Claus, you stand accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?
	Bender	Not Santa!
	Professor Farnsworth	There he is again!
	Hyper-Chicken	Now, Pramala, I know it's scary in that there witness box but t'ain't no need to fear me. [He clucks and she flinches.] I'm sorry, I thought you was corn. Now, would you please point at that robot over there. [She points and the court gasps.] No further questions. [He walks off, sits down and opens his briefcase. There are nine chicks inside.] Daddy done good, huh?
	Bender	Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
	Pramala	Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
	Bender	And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
	Whitey	Quit badgering the witness!
	Hyper-Chicken	Badger? Where?
	Whitey	Whereas I have a ham dinner with mayonnaise waiting for me at my mansion, I find the defendant guilty. [The court gasps.] Santa Claus, I hereby sentence you to be executed at sundown.
	Leela	It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.
	Smitty	Deactivated robot walking. We got a deactivated robot walking here.
	Robot	Hey, Santa, when you see the Robot Devil, tell him I'm-a comin'!
	Bender	Hey, that guy said to tell you that--
	Robot Devil	I heard him!
	Aide #1	Greetings, masters. My companion and I made lots of toys.
	Leela	Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent.
	Santa	Do what you will. But we'll see who has the last ho.
	Leela	There.
	Fry	Oh, no! The ice is melting!
	Leela	The pollution from the factory! It caused a greenhouse effect.
	Aide #1	That would explain this heat.
	Fry	And your breezy short-shorts!
	Aide #2	Uh, yeah! That would explain it.
	Fry	Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!
	Leela	Especially for Bender.
	Santa	Look out, Earth. I'm dreaming of a red Xmas.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Ah, good old Maggie! [His watch flies off his arm and sticks to a magnet followed by a flask and a iron from his pocket.] Eh? When I pull this switch, these powerful electromagnets will tear you limb-from-limb, killing you in the most humane possible manner.
	Bender	But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	It is for the witnesses because it's not boring! [He turns to the applauding witnesses and waves to them. He puts on his executioner mask and walks over to the switch.] The instant this random number generator reaches zero, you'll be executed.
	Bender	Aw!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Ten. Three. Twelve. Three again.
	Leela	Stop the execution!
	Bender	Leela!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Fifteen. Negative eight.
	Leela	You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it.
	Fry	I'm Santa Claus!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	What? Twenty-seven.
	Hermes	No. I'm Santa Claus.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	Six.
	Amy	[disguised, deeper voice] We're also Santa Claus.
	Zoidberg	And I'm his friend Jesus!
	Fry	Your Mayor-ness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us.
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	You people aren't Santa. You're not even robots! Ninety-one. How dare you lie in front of Jesus! [The display shows "00".] Hey! Zero!
	Bender	No! Not the magnets! [His eyes widen.] [singing] Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home. [The witnesses applaud.] Swing low, sweet...
	Fry	This is horrible.
	Professor Farnsworth	But it's not boring!
	Santa	Ho, ho, ho!
	Mayor Poopenmeyer	My God! The real Santa! Get him, Jesus!
	Zoidberg	I help those who help themselves.
	Bender	Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!
	Santa	I'm not here to kill you, Bender! I need you to help me save Xmas.
	Bender	Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?
	Fry	Don't do it! He's evil!
	Santa	I know he is but I have no choice. I'm running late and if I don't complete my brutal rampage, well, it just wouldn't be Xmas. I guess what I'm asking is: Bender, won't you join my slaying tonight?
	Bender	Well ... 'tis the season!
	Man	My hair!
	Woman	My wedding cake!
	Santa	Let it snow!
	Bender	Merry Xmas, kids!
	Leela	This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as ever.
	Professor Farnsworth	No heat.
	Amy	No power.
	Hermes	Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig.
	Fry	Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
	Leela	What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart.
	Fry	But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!
	Professor Farnsworth	That's a big crock of-- [There is an explosion outside.] Hold me!
	Bender	On, Trasher! On, Smasher! [The Kwanzaabot flies alongside.] Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?
	Kwanzaabot	Ah, you didn't hear about it? Chanukah Zombie's having a luau at the B'nai B'rith! You comin'?
	Bender	Word!
	Santa	By the way, Bender, here's a small token of my appreciation for being Santa while I was trapped in the ice.
	Bender	Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here.
	Santa	Oh, it might appear empty but the message is clear: Play Santa again and I'll kill you next year! [He kicks Bender out of the sleigh into the fiery city below and flies away.] Ho, ho, ho!
