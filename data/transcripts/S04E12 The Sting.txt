	Bender	A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings! [He hits the ball and it interacts with the screen, landing in the lake.] Oh, he slices! Into the water! Oh, man! [He plugs a cable into his head and appears on the screen.] [muttering] Boy, I tell you, buddy!
	Professor Farnsworth	Bad news, everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.
	Fry	Hooray!
	Bender	Not good enough!
	Leela	Why? Says who?
	Professor Farnsworth	Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
	Fry	Woo-hoo!
	Bender	We live to suck another day!
	Leela	We're just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
	Professor Farnsworth	Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
	Leela	That doesn't sound so dangerous.
	Professor Farnsworth	This is no ordinary honey! It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death.
	Hermes	And that's if you're not allergic. You don't wanna know what happens then. Oh, no, no. God, no!
	Professor Farnsworth	Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano.
	Hermes	I didn't want to know!
	Professor Farnsworth	These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly.
	Fry	Larger than an American sedan? [He gasps.] How big is the honeycomb?
	Hermes	Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
	Bender	It's not small?
	Hermes	No, no, no.
	Leela	It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on, boys.
	Fry	But, Leela, we're no good.
	Leela	Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself.
	Fry	I'm not scared of that at all.
	Leela	Now, bees communicate by dancing.
	Fry	Like my parents! Oh, wait, that was hitting.
	Leela	So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
	Bender	Ah, good. I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance. [He dances.] [in bee] You stink. Bender's great. Deal with it.
	Leela	Bender, quick! Waggle something!
	Bender	Uh ... [in bee] Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?
	Bee	[in bee] Duh!
	Fry	Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
	Leela	Relax. Everything'll be fine.
	Fry	Oh, my God! The old Planet Express ship.
	Leela	There's the black box.
	Man	[on tape] Captain, the bees have us surrounded! Oh, the Professor was right. We're not as good as his old crew!
	Captain	[on tape] Well I aim to prove him wrong. It'll take more than a few deadly, deadly bees to-- [The buzzing gets louder.] [screaming] Oh, Lord!
	Leela	Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static.
	Bender	Ew!
	Leela	We found it! The honeycomb hideout.
	Fry	Hey, what's this goop?
	Leela	Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
	Fry	Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make tastes good? [The honeycomb underneath him gives way and he falls into the jelly. He screams.] Help! I can't swim in jelly, as far as I know!
	Leela	Look! [A small bee floats towards them on the jelly.] It's a baby queen! Aw, she's so cute! You adorable wittle, itty-bitty, fuzzy-wuzzy--
	Fry	Leela! Stop bonding and let's go! I got jelly in my underpants!
	Leela	I'm taking this bee with us. With a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
	Bender	[in bee] Pick up the pace, lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks. [The bees glare at Bender.] I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.
	Bee	[in bee] He insulted our fat queen.
	Queen	[in bee] You try keeping your figure after 10,000 kids.
	Leela	This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high-speed self-contained escape pack crisis response unit. Quick!
	Leela	[shouting] Good luck, Bender!
	Bender	I'm back, baby!
	Fry	We made it! We're alive!
	Leela	Burn on that, old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die.
	Fry	Leela, we got lucky this time. But you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
	Leela	Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away.
	Fry	Look out! [Leela screams and the bee flies at her. Fry steps in front of her.] You want her, you're gonna have to go through me!
	Leela	You call that a wound? That's a boo-boo tops. But thanks for trying to save me, Fry. [There is no response.] [alarmed] Fry?! [Fry is hunched over on the floor, clutching where the sting hit him. Leela gasps.] He's... he's dead!
	Bender	[crying] Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
	Leela	[crying] It was all my fault! He died because of me!
	Professor Farnsworth	[Farnsworth begins patting her on the hand in a comforting manner.] No, no, no, no, no, no. [He turns to Bender.] [shouting] I'm lying to make her feel better!
	LaBarbara	Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?
	Hermes	It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheck.
	Amy	He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.
	Zoidberg	I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
	Changstein el Gamahl	I barely knew Philip. But, as a clergyman, I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
	Hermes	Soothe us with sweet lies.
	Changstein el Gamahl	It may comfort you to know Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without saying it caused him to empty his bowels. [Everyone gasps.] We now commend Fry's body to the ages.
	Amy	He's walking on sunshine now.
	Professor Farnsworth	This makes me the oldest member of my family.
	Kug	Him do good snu-snu.
	Bender	All those times I said "Kill all humans," I'd always whisper "except one". Fry was that one. [sobbing] And I never told him so!
	Terry	[melodramatically] Farewell, from the world of tomorrow!
	Leela	[softly crying] They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain. [She picks up a box marked "Memories of Fry" and takes out a collectible spoon from when he was the Trisolian Emperor. She dips it into the jar and eats the honey and begins to become a little light-hearted.] Mmm... It's good. [She eats some more and stops crying.] I feel funny. Ha-ha funny!
	Fry	Leela?
	Leela	Fry? I thought you were dead.
	Fry	Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!
	Leela	Impressive! But it does sorta support my you-are-dead theory.
	Fry	Then I'll prove I'm alive, by telling you something only I could know. [A large, translucent image of him appears behind him and Leela and they both speak.] There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.
	Leela	It's too beautiful to open. Can I open it?
	Fry	Sure. There's just one thing I want you to.
	Leela	What?
	Fry	I want you to wake up.
	Leela	Wake up? But I'm not--
	Leela	In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
	Professor Farnsworth	Of course he still exists: As a frozen corpse in outer space! [He laughs then sighs.] Oh, I made myself sad.
	Leela	Well, here goes.
	Zoidberg	Bupkis!
	Bender	Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure.
	Leela	Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
	Bender	No. Nothing. Not at all. No way, Jos√©! [He opens his chest cabinet and takes out the same gift from Leela's dream.] Here it is.
	Leela	You took this from Fry's locker?
	Bender	Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing.
	Leela	That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
	Professor Farnsworth	Bull pies!
	Professor Farnsworth	Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five-pound Ouija board.
	Leela	Is this some sort of brain scanner?
	Professor Farnsworth	Some sort, yes. In France it's called a guillotine.
	Leela	Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, easily.
	Bender	Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, I suppose there's a slim-- [The scanner dings and he gasps.] I don't believe it!
	Leela	What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
	Professor Farnsworth	No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back. Remarkable!
	Leela	But ... my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have known the gift was in Fry's locker?
	Hermes	Easy! He told you about it before he died and your grief-roasted mind blocked it out.
	Leela	Are you saying I'm going crazy?
	Professor Farnsworth	No, no! No one's saying that. But I'm certainly thinking it loudly.
	Fry	Hi, Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
	Leela	Shut up! I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.
	Fry	Oh, yeah? [The space around them changes to a purple forest.] Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden?
	Leela	Well, yes, technically. But it's still very sweet of you.
	Fry	Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?
	Leela	Oh, Fry! You must be alive; I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before.
	Fry	Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold.
	Leela	Thank you. It's all so beautiful. I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
	Fry	You can. All you have to do is wake up.
	Leela	No, no! Don't say that! This is real!
	Leela	Not another dream! [She gasps and drops the sheets from around her. She is wearing Fry's jacket.] Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
	Petunia	[from apartment] Quit your bragging! My boyfriend's alive too! [There is a thump.] Not 'nymore!
	Bender	That's better!
	Leela	Fry's alive! I have proof!
	Amy	No way!
	Professor Farnsworth	You lie!
	Bender	You do not!
	Hermes	I'm from Jamaica, the "Show Me" island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny.
	Leela	But he gave me his jacket. Look.
	Professor Farnsworth	That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red. That's your jacket. An off-the-rack, lime green affair.
	Leela	But Fry-- His jacket-- And when I woke up it was on me.
	Hermes	You're under a lot of guilt stress, Leela. Here, work it off.
	Leela	[squeezing] I am not under stress, damnit!
	Amy	[Farnsworth's voice] Everything's going to be alright, Leela.
	Leela	What?
	Amy	I said everything's going to be alright.
	Leela	Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
	Bender	A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!
	Leela	I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
	Professor Farnsworth	You've been taking space honey? Be careful, you purple-haired imbecile!
	Zoidberg	One spoonful calms you down. Two spoonfuls help you sleep. But three spoonfuls and you'll go into a sleep so deep you'll never wake up. Never!
	Hermes	[Farnsworth's voice] Never!
	Bender	[Amy's voice] Never!
	Leela	One spoonful to calm me down. [She swallows it and falls over.] OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep. [She eats another one but nothing happens.] Uh-oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. [She swipes at the jar with the spoon but misses and knocks the royal jelly onto the sofa.] Oh, my gosh! I'd better get a sponge. [The jelly forms a Fry-shaped object.] Fry? [She rubs her eye.] Is that you? I don't need a sponge!
	Fry	Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
	Professor Farnsworth	Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin--
	Bender	And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
	Professor Farnsworth	Yes, Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being.
	Fry	Neat!
	Bender	This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again. [He takes Fry's credit cards out of his chest cabinet.] Let's go get hammered!
	Zoidberg	I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk.
	Leela	Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.
	Fry	Me too.
	Leela	Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
	Fry	Uh, not everything.
	Leela	What? What do you mean?
	Fry	You have to wake up.
	Leela	Wake up? Oh, no! No! It can't be!
	Leela	Pooh!
	Leela	I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive. But when I'm awake, my mind plays tricks on me.
	Hermes	Oh, take it easy, Leela.
	Amy	In every life we have some trouble.
	Bender	But when you worry, you make it double.
	Amy	and [singing] Don't worry! Bee happy!
	Professor Farnsworth	[singing] The landlord says your rent is late.
	Hermes	[singing] He might have to litigate.
	Bender	[singing] But don't worry!
	Bee	[singing] Bee--
	Professor Farnsworth	[singing] Happy!
	Zoidberg	[singing] Ain't got no cash,Ain't got no style,Ladies vomit when I smile,But does Zoidberg worry?Feh! You wish!
	Bee	[singing] Bee--
	Zoidberg	[singing] Happy!
	Hermes	Don't worry now, Amy!
	Amy	OK! I'm happy!
	Bender	Take us home, Bender! [singing] Don't worry!
	Bee	[singing] Bee--
	Bender	[singing] Happy!
	Leela	Uh, were you just singing?
	Bender	No, I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing. Court order.
	Leela	I'll find Fry's coffin, get his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane.
	Leela	OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed.
	Leela	What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
	Professor Farnsworth	, , and [chanting] You killed Fry! You killed Fry! You killed Fry ...!
	Leela	Stop it! Stop it!
	Bender	You killed Fry!
	Leela	OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it. [She looks at a photo of Fry on her bedside.] The only time I feel alright is in my dreams, with you. [She takes the jar of honey.] Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever. [She starts to eat.] One. Two [She dips in a third time.] Here goes. Goodbye, waking world.
	Fry's Photo	Leela! No! [A bee flies past.] Listen to me, you don't want to lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life. I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!
	Leela	[crying] Then what am I s'posed to do?
	Fry's Photo	Fight it!
	Leela	[crying] I can't!
	Fry's Photo	You can! The Leela I know doesn't give up this easily.
	Leela	OK. I'll try. [The bee buzzes past her again. She waves her arm around.] Go away!
	Fry's Photo	I don't know if you can hear me, Leela, but there's something I wanna tell you. I love you.
	Leela	[crying] I'm so scared, Fry. I don't know what to do.
	Fry's Photo	Just wake up, Leela. Please. Just wake up.
	Leela	[crying] I don't understand what you mean!
	Fry	[crying] Just wake up. Please. Just wake up, Leela.
	Leela	Fry. You're alive!
	Fry	Leela! You're awake!
	Leela	Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me. [She looks around.] Where am I?
	Fry	In the hospital. The ambulance took you here right after the bee stung you.
	Leela	But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
	Fry	The stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
	Hermes	Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
	Bender	You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
	Amy	The doctor said you'd never wake up.
	Leela	Really? How long was I out?
	Amy	Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
	Zoidberg	And he talked non-stop. Like a parrot of the sea, he was!
	Fry	I though that maybe if you heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together. But who knows if it really got through.
	Leela	It got through, Fry. [She hugs him.] It got through.
	Leela	[whispering; over credits] You could really use a shower.
	Fry	[whispering; over credits] You too!
