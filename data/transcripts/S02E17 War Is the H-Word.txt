	Fry	Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum ... ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham.
	Bender	And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
	Clerk	Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your 5% military discount comes to $95. [He hands over the money, picks up his bag and leaves. Fry slaps his gum on the counter and the clerk rings it up.] That'll be 40 cents.
	Fry	I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
	Clerk	Well that's only for people in the military.
	Bender	What? This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
	Clerk	Alright, look. Our policy is: If for any reason you're not completely satisfied, I hate you.
	Bender	OK, now I'm mad!
	Fry	Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, monsignor.
	Bender	Hello. We're here because we, uh, love our planet!
	Recruitment Officer	Sign here on the dotted line, patriots, and I'll give you your discount cards.
	Fry	Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?
	Bender	You know, playing you all for chumps?
	Recruitment Officer	Correct. There's no obligation. [Fry and Bender laugh as they sign. The man takes their papers back.] Unless, of course, war were declared.
	Fry	What's that?
	Recruitment Officer	War were declared.
	Professor Farnsworth	Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage.
	Hermes	I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing you now.
	Leela	I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
	Zapp	Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy.
	Leela	What?
	Zapp	It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside female troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army decided women weren't fit for service. Not when I'm in charge.
	Leela	You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson.
	Zapp	If it's a lesson in love, watch out; I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, Kif?
	Kif	"Sex-lexia".
	Zapp	Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all.
	Bender	Great, we're gonna die.
	Fry	And this ham gum is all bones.
	Zapp	Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon.
	Richard Nixon	This is the brass ring, fellas. [Kif presses a button, the lights dim and a holographic image of a planet appears above the soldiers.] Planet Spheron One!
	Fry	Cool effect!
	Zapp	It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic value. Questions?
	Soldier #1	Why is this Godforsaken planet worth dying for?
	Zapp	Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying.
	Fry	Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?
	Zapp	A valid question. [The lights come back on.] We know nothing about their language, their history or what they look like. But we can assume this: They stand for everything we don't stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks.
	Bender	They look like dorks!
	Zapp	What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue? [chuckling] Tent got your... [talking] Kif, write that down and send it to "Humor In Uniform".
	Fry	Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales!
	Kif	That new recruit is phenomenal, sir.
	Zapp	Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds ... [Kif frowns.] ... and 16 minutes ... and 12 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier.
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is.
	Zapp	As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private?
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Lee-- [She covers her mouth.] La ... man. La Man ... Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir.
	Zapp	Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly, your hand, while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion do you use?
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Pert and Popular, sir.
	Zapp	Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular.
	Kif	What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?
	Zapp	Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows. [Leela sneaks off.] Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young man fills me with hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing to me.
	Kif	Ew!
	Zapp	[sexfully] Hello!
	Richard Nixon	Mmm! Now that's a nice ros√©. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate and, wouldn't you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story.
	Zapp	Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you.
	Fry	Mind if we sit with you?
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.
	Fry	Good point ... I guess.
	Bender	You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle.
	Hick	So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?
	Fry	Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with.
	Leela	Really? [disguised, deeper voice] What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or Cyclops?
	Fry	Cyclops.
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Aww, she sounds sweet.
	Bender	But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a--
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Stop! Stop flattering me!
	Zapp	[shouting] Ten hut! [Everyone sits to attention.] Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon: The flaming star of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, Lemon, do you like to read? I just got a great book on tape. It's about life in Ancient Greece and--
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better--
	Zapp	Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
	Richard Nixon	We are now in position above Spheron One. This is the moment we were training for all yesterday afternoon.
	Zapp	And now for the battle plan: As you all know, the key to victory is the element of surprise. Surprise!
	Fry	It's creepy here.
	Soldier #1	This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
	Fry	And then the battle's not so bad?
	Soldier #1	Oh, right. I forgot about the battle.
	Fry	What's happening?
	Hick	Holy shoot! Lookie!
	Fry	The enemy! They're balls!
	Leela	Charge your gun, Fry.
	Fry	Oh, right.
	Zapp	Watch where you're shooting, private! You spooked Felicity. [He pats the horse's neck.] There, there, boy.
	Soldier #1	[hoarse] Give this to my son.
	Bender	You got it!
	Soldier #1	[hoarse] Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives.
	Bender	Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.
	Hick	Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter. [Fry quivers behind a rock as balls bounce towards him. He screams, blasts a hole in the ground and hides in it. The balls bounce past.] Fry, you emu-bellied coward!
	Fry	[shouting] Bender! No!
	Bender	If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender.
	P.A. Announcer	[on tannoy] Incoming wounded. All operating personnel report to tent four, repeat, four-- I mean five! Repeat, four.
	Nurse	Are you ready to operate, doctor?
	Zoidberg	[washing his claws] I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery. [He laughs.] I kid! I kid!
	Zoidberg	Scalpel. [The nurse hands him a scalpel and he cuts something inside the hick.] Blood bucket. [She hands him a bucket and he puts it under the operating table.] Priest. Next patient.
	iHawk	Gee, Zoidberg, leave some for the enemy to kill.
	Nurse	Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone! He has twice the training you do.
	iHawk	Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!
	Zoidberg	See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff.
	iHawk	When will the killing end?
	Zapp	Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly, he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice.
	Fry	That wasn't cowardice.
	Zapp	I'm de-promoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?
	Kif	Being your assistant.
	Zapp	Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you shall henceforth serve as Kif's assistant.
	Fry	That doesn't sound too bad.
	Kif	You speak when I tell you to, you filthy worm!
	Zoidberg	I'm afraid he's gone.
	Hick	Whoa, doc, I ain't dead.
	Zoidberg	Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor.
	iHawk	Believe it all you want, that won't make it true. [He laughs then flicks his switch from "irreverent" to "maudlin".] This isn't a war, it's a murder. [He flicks it back.] This isn't a war, it's a moider!
	Hick	Bender, old buddy, hang in there.
	Zapp	Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on it. I hereby order that in Bender's honour he be melted down and made into a statue of himself.
	Richard Nixon	Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to something here. I want this robot fixed. Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero!
	Nurse	Are you read to operate, doctor?
	iHawk	I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.
	Zoidberg	That's my joke! I'll kill you!
	Zapp	Ah! Pre-war scotch! [Enter Bender with wheels attached to his side.] Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp.
	Bender	I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
	Zapp	Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!
	Kif	Actually, sir--
	Zapp	Make me a new one.
	Kif	Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts. I see two almonds touching!
	Richard Nixon	Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire on me, so I'm sending you on one last mission.
	Bender	Hot diggidy daffodil!
	Richard Nixon	A mission of peace.
	Bender	[disappointed] Oh!
	Zapp	You'll be negotiating with the aliens' mysterious leaders, the Brain Balls. They've got a lot of brains and they've got a lot of kutzpa!
	Richard Nixon	Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger.
	Kissenger	How are you?
	Bender	Is he any good?
	Richard Nixon	Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff said!
	Richard Nixon	[singing] I'm so dizzy,My head is spinning,Like a whirlpool,It never ends.
	Zapp	A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Too low! ... Lower!
	Fry	[singing] I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh.
	Zapp	Private Lemon, no need to leave. [He opens the door to his shower stall and steps out.] My stall just became free.
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Maybe you should put on a towel, sir.
	Zapp	Right! Right! [He walks away and Leela hurries into the stall and shuts the door. Zapp has wrapped the towel around his head and squirts something onto his hand.] I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended. [sexfully] If I should accidentally put too much on my hands, perhaps I could rub it onto you.
	Richard Nixon	Brannigan!
	Zapp	Hm?
	Richard Nixon	My God, cover yourself. I didn't live a thousand years and travel a quadrillion miles to look at another man's gizmo.
	Zapp	Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I-I didn't realise. Kif, raise him up about nipple-high.
	Richard Nixon	Come on, Brannigan, stuff yourself into a uniform. We've gotta get off this planet before the bomb goes off.
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Bomb? What bomb?
	Zapp	The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot.
	Richard Nixon	Zapp. Zapp!
	Zapp	Hm?
	Richard Nixon	Inspect the troops later. It's time to activate the bomb.
	Kissenger	Now, as for economic co-operation--
	Bender	Whoa! Scuse me.
	P.A. Announcer	[on tannoy] Attention: All personnel evacuate the planet immediately. And not just because it's meat loaf night.
	Zapp	Come along, Lemon, before this whole dump blows up.
	Leela	[disguised, deeper voice] Uh, Commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?
	Zapp	Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice-activated. It will detonate the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word.
	Fry	What's the word, uh, sir?
	Zapp	It's the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from this convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used words. [He presses a button on the database and a list comes up.] Number 10, chump; number nine, chumpette; number eight, yours; number seven, up; number six, pimpmobile; number five, bite; number four, my ... [Leela gasps.] ... number three, shiny; number two, daffodil. And Bender's number one most frequently-uttered word, the word which, if uttered, will blow up this entire planet: Ass.
	Fry	We don't have long!
	Brain Ball #1	We demand bouncing, followed by rolling, followed by rolling of the third type.
	Kissenger	Say what?
	Bender	My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the, uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region.
	Fry	OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender.
	Leela	Hi-yah!
	Fry	Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me.
	Leela	[shouting] Come on! We gotta save Bender.
	Fry	You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him.
	Leela	Fry, don't you recognise me?
	Fry	[squinting] Hermes?
	Zapp	Lee? When will I see you again? [He sees Leela and Fry holding hands and gasps.] The two of you are good friends? But I thought we would be good friends. [contemptuous] Well, let's see how friendly you get when you're sharing a prison cell!
	Leela	Hey, Zapp!
	Zapp	Leela!
	Fry	Leela!
	Zapp	So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman.
	Leela	Let's do it again sometime.
	Brain Ball #2	The Elders tell of a young ball much like you. He bounced three metres in the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres in the air. Then he bounced four metres in the air. Do I make myself clear?
	Kissenger	Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy.
	Bender	These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their-- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?
	Kissenger	This isn't a productive area of discussion.
	Leela	We're here. I followed the bouncing balls. [Fry stands at the door with a parachute on his back.] I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
	Fry	OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward. [He puts on his helmet and sighs.] Will you push me?
	Leela	[shouting] I already did!
	Fry	[shouting] Thank you! [He pulls his ripcord and hits the ground as soon as the parachute deploys. Balls bounce on him and he kicks a few away and rides one like a space hopper.] At last, war has made me into a man.
	Kissenger	Please, gentlemen, we must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks.
	Brain Ball #1	We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh variety.
	Bender	Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say. [He climbs onto the table and turns around.] Bite my shiny metal--
	Fry	Stop! You can't say the next word.
	Bender	Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch.
	Fry	Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!
	Kissenger	Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer ham. [Fry smiles and Bender laughs.] What? What is funny?
	Bender	Bender's got the upper hand now. [He closes his door and turns to the Brain Balls.] The name of the game is "Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet". [Everyone gasps.] I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!
	Brain Ball #1	Please, stay calm. There's no need to bounce of the handle.
	Bender	That's it, I'm saying it! "A" is for--
	Brain Ball #1	Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's demands. The war is over. Our home planet is yours.
	Fry	Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?
	Brain Ball #2	Correct.
	Bender	Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.
	Brain Ball #1	May you bounce in peace.
	Bender	Get the hell off my planet.
	Professor Farnsworth	Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. [shouting] Wake up!
	Bender	Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?
	Zoidberg	I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
	Professor Farnsworth	It's stuck in there with glue or something, I don't know.
	Bender	[ironic] Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say "ass"? [He gasps.] Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!
	Leela	We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
	Amy	It's from the list of words you almost never say.
	Bender	That's using your ass. So, what's the word?
	Hermes	We think it's better if you don't know.
	Bender	Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Ooh, is it "please"?
	Fry	No.
	Bender	Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! "Thanks"!
	Leela	Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.
	Bender	Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it "sorry"? No. "Fun-derful"? Uh, "non-alcoholic"?
	Amy	Quit it!
	Fry	Bender!
	Hermes	Stop it, mon!
	Zoidberg	Enough already!
	Bender	[from lab] "Compassion"? "Shrimptoast"? "Antiquing"? [There is an explosion.] I'm alright!
